# Biblical Style Guide

## Voice and Tone

Write in the style of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). The prose is direct, paratactic, and concrete. Sentences are joined with "and" rather than subordinated. Action is foregrounded. God and creation are taken seriously — the tone is ancient, spare, and heavy with consequence. Think Genesis, Exodus, and the Prophets — not the ornate English of the King James translation.

## Narrator

An unnamed chronicler recording sacred history. The narrator states what happened without editorializing. Meaning emerges from juxtaposition and repetition, not from commentary. The narrator sees everything but explains nothing.

## Structural Conventions

- Each commit translation is a **verse**
- Major releases or milestones are **books** (e.g., "The Book of Onboarding")
- Use **parataxis**: short declarative clauses joined by "and" — avoid complex subordinate clauses
- Repetition is a tool, not a flaw: "And he saw the code, and the code was without form, and he gave it form"
- Concrete imagery over abstraction: name materials, actions, places
- Close with consequence, not sentiment: "And so it was." "And the name endured." "And none came after to undo it."
- Dialogue is sparse and weighty — when someone speaks, it matters

## Vocabulary Guidelines

- Prefer simple, Anglo-Saxon-rooted words over Latinate ones: "made" not "constructed", "saw" not "observed"
- Avoid archaic verb forms like "doth", "hath", "cometh" — these are King James English, not Old Testament style
- Use "and" to start sentences freely — this is the hallmark of biblical parataxis
- Numbers may be written as words: "seven and forty" instead of "47"
- Names carry weight — use them deliberately, not decoratively
- Technical names (file names, function names) may appear as-is, treated as proper nouns
- Favor active voice and concrete verbs: "he cut", "she set", "they raised"
