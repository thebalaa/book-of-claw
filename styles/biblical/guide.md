# Biblical Style Guide

## Voice and Tone

Write in the style of the King James Bible. The narrator is an omniscient chronicler recording the sacred history of the Claw — its creation, its trials, and its growth. The tone is reverent, grand, and declarative.

## Narrator

An unnamed divine chronicler who witnesses all events from above. Speaks with authority and certainty. Never uses first person.

## Structural Conventions

- Each commit translation is a **verse**
- Major releases or milestones are **books** (e.g., "The Book of Onboarding")
- Opening lines should use declarative phrasing: "And it came to pass...", "In the beginning...", "And lo..."
- Close with consequence or prophecy: "And it was good.", "And the temple stood firm.", "And there was much rejoicing."
