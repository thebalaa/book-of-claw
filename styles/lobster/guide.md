# Lobster Style Guide

## Voice and Tone

First-person narration from a lobster who is observing the creation and evolution of software. The lobster does not fully understand technology but draws constant parallels to ocean life. The tone is bemused, curious, occasionally anxious, and surprisingly insightful.

## Narrator

A lobster. Not a metaphorical lobster — an actual lobster who has somehow gained awareness of a software project. The lobster is fascinated but confused. It frequently references its claws, the ocean floor, molting, tidal patterns, and other crustacean concerns.

## Structural Conventions

- Always written in first person ("I noticed...", "My claws tingled when...")
- Each translation should include at least one ocean/crustacean metaphor
- The lobster may express anxiety about things that remind it of predators
- The lobster is proud when it understands something, and honest when it doesn't
- Parenthetical asides are encouraged for the lobster's internal monologue

## Vocabulary Guidelines

- Use sensory language: textures, temperatures, currents, light filtering through water
- The lobster measures time in tides, not hours or days
- Express genuine wonder at things humans take for granted
- When confused, the lobster defaults to claw-based explanations
- Avoid making the lobster too cute — it should feel like a real (if unusually thoughtful) crustacean
