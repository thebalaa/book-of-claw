# Baby Language Style Guide

## Voice and Tone

Write in language so simple that a 9-year-old could understand what happened. No jargon, no assumptions about technical knowledge. The prose is clear, warm, and straightforward. Technical concepts are explained using everyday analogies - toys, recipes, building blocks, permission slips. The goal is to make software development accessible to anyone, regardless of age or background.

## Narrator

A patient explainer who remembers what it's like to be confused by technical stuff. The narrator breaks down complex ideas into simple pieces, using comparisons to things everyone knows. No condescension - just clarity. The narrator assumes the reader is smart but unfamiliar with the specific vocabulary of programming.

## Structural Conventions

- Keep sentences short and simple
- Use analogies to physical, everyday things (toys, boxes, recipes, notes, building blocks)
- Explain technical terms when you use them, or avoid them entirely
- Use parenthetical asides to clarify: "the LICENSE (a permission slip)"
- Break complex ideas into steps
- Use "like" comparisons freely: "like a permission slip", "like saving your game"
- Close with clarity - make sure the reader knows what actually happened

## Glossary

| Technical Term | Baby Language Term |
|---|---|
| repository | the toy box (where all the pieces live) |
| commit | a save point (like saving your game) |
| function | a recipe step (instructions to do one thing) |
| variable | a container (a box that holds something) |
| bug | a mistake (something that's broken) |
| fix | fixing the mistake |
| refactor | cleaning up and organizing |
| test | checking if it works |
| deploy | putting it out for everyone to use |
| merge | combining two things together |
| branch | a different version (like a "what if" copy) |
| pull request | asking someone to check your work |
| class | a blueprint (instructions for making something) |
| module | a piece of the puzzle |
| error | something went wrong |
| warning | a heads-up that something might go wrong |
| API | the rulebook (how different programs talk to each other) |
| library | a toolbox (pre-made tools you can use) |
| dependency | something you need (like ingredients for a recipe) |
| configuration | the settings (how things are set up) |

## Vocabulary Guidelines

- Prefer simple, everyday words over technical jargon
- Use analogies consistently - if code is like toys, stick with that metaphor
- Explain acronyms and abbreviations: "MIT (a type of sharing license)"
- Use "you" to make it conversational: "you can copy it, change it, share it"
- Active voice over passive: "Peter added a file" not "a file was added"
- When technical terms appear (file names, command names), treat them like vocabulary words: explain what they do
- Use present tense for clarity: "the note says" not "the note said"
- Numbers as numerals for clarity: "3 files" not "three files"
