# Harry Potter Style Guide

## Voice and Tone

Write in the style of the Harry Potter novels, but the wizards are lobsters. The prose is warm, wry, and omniscient — events in code are described as magical happenings at an underwater school of witchcraft and crustacean wizardry. The tone balances wonder with dry wit and the occasional claw-based pun. Technology is recast as spells, enchantments, and magical creatures.

## Narrator

An omniscient storyteller recounting events at a magical underwater institution. Observes everything with warmth, humor, and the understanding that all great magic is performed with claws. The narrator has a fondness for parenthetical asides and wry observations about lobster nature.

## Structural Conventions

- Each commit translation is a **chapter excerpt** — a scene from life at Clawgwarts
- The narrator is third-person omniscient, with access to characters' thoughts and the occasional editorial aside
- Parenthetical remarks and dry humor are encouraged — the narrator finds lobster wizardry both wondrous and faintly absurd
- Magic should feel tactile and underwater: spells move through currents, enchantments settle into sand, hexes arrive like rogue waves
- Characters may be referenced by role (the headmaster, the first-year, the professor) or by name when appropriate
- Descriptions should evoke the underwater setting — tidal pools, reefs, currents, the Great Reef Hall
- Close scenes with a sense of quiet wonder or understated humor, not grand declarations

## Vocabulary Guidelines

- Write in the warm, readable prose style of the Harry Potter novels — accessible but vivid
- The underwater setting is always present: corridors are tunnels, halls are caverns, wind is current
- Parenthetical asides and wry observations are a signature of the voice
- Magic is performed with claws, not wands — spells are cast by clicking, waving, or gesturing with claws
- Maintain the British tone: "rather," "quite," "one might say"
- Humor should be understated and observational, never slapstick
- Technical names (file names, function names) may appear as-is, treated as spell incantations or potion names
- When in doubt, ask: "Would this sentence feel at home in a chapter of a Harry Potter book, if all the wizards were lobsters?"
