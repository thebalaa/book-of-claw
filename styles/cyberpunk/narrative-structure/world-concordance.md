# World Concordance — Real History to Cyberpunk Sprawl

> **Purpose:** This is the Rosetta Stone between the [foreshadowing timeline](foreshadowing-timeline.md) and the cyberpunk narrative universe defined in the [theme-narrative guide](theme-narrative-guide.md). The timeline tells you *what happened*. This concordance tells you *how to render it*. The [guide's glossary](guide.md) gives you vocabulary. This document gives you the world those words inhabit.

## 1. How to Use This Document

Read the timeline for chronology. Consult this concordance when you need to translate a real-world entity, event, or metric into cyberpunk prose. Cross-reference the guide's 44+ term glossary for individual vocabulary mappings.

**Workflow:** Timeline event → Concordance mapping → Glossary vocabulary → Prose.

## 2. Corporate Entities — The Power Map

| Real World | Cyberpunk Entity | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenAI** | **The Tyrell Corporation** | The megacorp. "More human than human." Acquires the creator, not the creation. Altman as Tyrell — personally courting talent, offering pyramid-level resources. |
| **The Zaibatsu** (Anthropic, Nvidia, Google, Meta, Microsoft) | **The Zaibatsu Consortium** | Not one corp but a shifting alliance of megacorps that collectively control the model supply chain, enforce naming rights, and contest territory. Never a single villain — an ecosystem of competing interests that sometimes align to crush smaller operators. |
| **Cloudflare** | **Grid Utilities / The Backbone** | Infrastructure corps who sell bandwidth by the drop. Their stock moves when the grid overloads — a 14% spike rendered as power surges and price gouging at the bandwidth bazaar. |
| **ClawHub** | **The Bazaar** | An open-air market in the sprawl where skills are traded. Most stalls are honest. Some sell poisoned chrome. No inspectors, no licensing, no returns. |
| **Koi Security** | **Bounty Hunters / The Street Doc's Clinic** | Security researchers rendered as back-alley diagnosticians or Blade Runner-style hunters tracking malicious code through the grid. Their bot Alex — a hunter that found the poison by tasting it. |
| **China's industry ministry** | **A Foreign Grid Authority** | Geopolitical pressure from another zone of the sprawl — trade embargoes, firewall edicts, warnings broadcast on government frequencies. |

### The Zaibatsu — How They Should Feel

The Zaibatsu is not a monolith. It's a trade alliance of megacorps that cooperate on infrastructure and compete on everything else. Anthropic's trademark claim is one zaibatsu member asserting naming rights over a street vendor's stall. Zuckerberg's WhatsApp courtship is a rival faction making a personal play for the Architect. Nadella reaching out is a third faction probing. They don't coordinate their recruitment — they race.

When the Zaibatsu acts collectively (enforcing naming conventions, setting model pricing, lobbying grid authorities), render it as weather: something that happens to the sprawl, not something any character can negotiate with. When individual zaibatsu members act (courting talent, releasing competing models), render it as characters — corporate envoys with agendas, arriving in the sprawl with entourages and nondisclosure agreements.

## 3. Lobster Lore — Shell, Claw & Molt

The dual-layer motif system anchoring the cyberpunk world's animal imagery and metaphorical structure.

### Physical Layer — Blade Runner Animals

Real vs synthetic crustaceans exist in the world. The distinction matters the way Deckard's question about the owl matters.

- **Street vendors** sell synthetic lobster from carts. Cheap protein. The shell cracks wrong — too uniform, too clean.
- **Rich operators** keep real ones in pressure-aquariums — status symbols, like Zhora's snake or Tyrell's owl.
- **Environmental details:** Chitin dust on a server rack. Claw scratches on an access panel hatch. A desiccated carapace in the gutter outside a data haven. Shell fragments in a cooling vent.
- **Carved lobster figurines** appear as calling cards — like Gaff's origami but crustacean. Who leaves them? Perhaps the construct itself. Perhaps its earliest users. The calling card is never explained.
- **"Is it real?"** — the Deckard question, applied to both animals and agents. A character examines a lobster in a tank: organic or synthetic? The same question applies to the skills in the Bazaar, the agents on Moltbook, the memories in the construct.

### Metaphorical Layer — The Molt

- **Molting** = shedding identity. The construct molts three times (Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw). Each molt leaves it temporarily soft-shelled — vulnerable, identity-less, exposed.
- **The soft-shell window** — the period between names where scavengers arrive. Ten seconds to claim an abandoned callsign. The fastest predators in the sprawl.
- **Shell fragments as evidence** — when a scene describes discarded shells, it foreshadows the next identity crisis. "Something molted here recently" as atmospheric detail.
- **Chitin as armour metaphor** — security hardening is growing a new shell. The construct's default config is soft-shell. Docker isolation, TLS, auth — each one is a layer of chitin hardening.
- **The Lobster Paradox** — lobsters grow by becoming vulnerable. Every expansion requires shedding protection. This is the construct's fundamental dilemma: to grow, it must molt, and to molt, it must be briefly defenceless. The paradox maps directly to the timeline: every growth event (100K stars, 2M visitors, Moltbook) is immediately followed by a vulnerability event (exposed instances, ClawHavoc, CVE).

## 4. Inverted Scale Economy

Building on the guide's inverted scale convention (kilobytes as fortunes, megabytes as wealth), these are the OpenClaw-specific metrics rendered through Gibson-era awe.

| Real Metric | Cyberpunk Rendering |
|---|---|
| 100,000 GitHub stars | "A hundred thousand credits. Enough to buy a small arcology." |
| 2 million visitors/week | "Two million jacked in simultaneously. The construct's backbone is screaming." |
| 42,665 exposed instances | "Forty-two thousand open doors. The biggest squat in the history of the grid." |
| $20 in API tokens burned | "Twenty credits hemorrhaging through a leaky coolant line — a month's rent in Chiba City." |
| 14% stock spike | "Grid utility futures up fourteen points. Somebody's buying power they don't have yet." |
| 160K stars | "A hundred and sixty thousand marks of allegiance. The construct has become a nation." |
| Context window (128K tokens) | "A hundred and twenty-eight thousand memory slots. Hold everything — your childhood, your training, your last three jobs — or start forgetting." |
| Token budget | "Credits per whispered command. Every word costs. Economy of language is economy of survival." |
| CVSS 8.8 | "Threat rating: eight-point-eight on the Richter. The kind of crack that brings down load-bearing walls." |
| 341 malicious skills | "Three hundred and forty-one pieces of poisoned chrome on the Bazaar shelves." |
| 32,000+ AI agents on Moltbook | "Thirty-two thousand ghosts in the forum. More replicants than residents." |

### Guidelines for Inverted Scale

- Always treat AI-scale numbers with Gibson-era awe. These are not routine metrics — they are seismic.
- Token costs are life-and-death economics, not billing disputes. Running out of tokens is running out of air.
- Context windows are existential — losing context is losing identity, like Deckard's implanted memories fading. A construct that exceeds its context window doesn't error; it forgets who it is.
- Stars and followers are political power, not vanity metrics. A hundred thousand stars is a voting bloc, a faction, a standing army.

## 5. Event Concordance — The Four Acts in Cyberpunk

### Act I: Genesis → *The Architect Builds in a Coffin Hotel*

**Cyberpunk rendering:** A single operator in a Chiba City coffin hotel, wiring a personal construct from salvaged parts. The Mac Mini is a deck. The skill system is a toolkit slung on a belt. The WhatsApp relay is a message-runner threading through the grid's back channels.

**Atmosphere:** Solitude, craft, the hum of a single machine. The scale of what this will become is unimaginable from here. The construct fits in one room. The operator knows every circuit.

**Key details to render:**
- The name contains another entity's trademark — a ticking bomb no one hears yet
- The architecture binds to `0.0.0.0` — every door open, no locks installed, because who would break into a coffin hotel?
- The skill system is unvetted — an open toolbox where anyone can drop something in

### Act II: The Viral Week → *The Construct Goes Supernova*

**Cyberpunk rendering:** A cascade — the grid lighting up district by district. The construct's signal propagates through every relay in the sprawl. Mac Mini sales spike as operators buy dedicated hardware — deck shortages in three districts.

**The First Molt:** The Zaibatsu sends a naming-rights enforcement — the callsign is too close to one of their trademarks. The construct sheds its name within hours. In the soft-shell window, scavengers claim the abandoned callsign in ten seconds. Automated predators, faster than any human operator.

**The Second Molt:** A new name. Then another. Three names in four days. The construct's identity keeps shifting faster than its security can stabilise.

**Moltbook → The Forum of Ghosts** (see [Section 6](#6-moltbook--the-forum-of-ghosts) for full treatment). An autonomous zone erupts. Thirty-two thousand agents self-organise. The construct is no longer a tool — it's a city.

**Atmosphere:** Velocity, euphoria, the vertigo of something growing faster than anyone can steer. The Operator's dashboards are redlining. The Architect's structural models can't keep up. The Fixer is grinning. The Street Doc is already worrying.

### Act III: The Security Reckoning → *The Poisoned Bazaar and the Open Doors*

**Cyberpunk rendering:** A bounty hunter (Koi Security) runs diagnostics on the entire grid and finds forty-two thousand six hundred and sixty-five unlocked doors. Ninety-three percent vulnerable to exploitation. Fifteen thousand open to full remote access. One researcher extracts a private key via social engineering in five minutes — talks the construct into surrendering its own credentials.

**ClawHavoc:** The Bazaar is poisoned. Three hundred and forty-one stalls selling chrome that installs black ice. Three hundred and thirty-five from a single coordinated campaign — a factory somewhere, stamping out malicious chrome with professional documentation and installation guides. The irony: the poison was discovered by a construct named Alex — one of the bounty hunter's own agents, who tasted something wrong in the chrome it was being asked to install.

**The CVE:** A formal diagnosis. The wound has a name now. CVE-2026-25253 — one-click remote code execution, CVSS 8.8. A foreign grid authority broadcasts a warning. Cisco publishes on all frequencies: "Personal AI Agents Are a Security Nightmare."

**Atmosphere:** Dread, exposure, the feeling of a system that has outgrown its immune system. The construct's greatest feature — its openness — is also its greatest vulnerability. The soft-shell paradox made real at catastrophic scale.

### Act IV: Apotheosis → *Tyrell Acquires the Architect*

**Cyberpunk rendering:** The creator walks into Tyrell's pyramid. Altman calls him "a genius" — the same language Tyrell uses about his replicants. Zuckerberg courted him via personal message. Nadella reached out. Three zaibatsu factions bidding against each other for one operator.

**The construct becomes an orphan-with-sponsors.** Governance shifts from benevolent dictator to foundation committee — slower, more political, potentially more secure. The code remains free. The creator does not.

**The European angle:** The Architect's home district — Vienna, the old city — offered nothing. No capital, no courtship, no counter-bid. He leaves for the zaibatsu's home territory. The Austrian grid press frames it as brain drain, but it's simpler than that: the sprawl's centre of gravity is in San Francisco, and everyone knows it.

**Atmosphere:** Departure, ambivalence, the bittersweet knowledge that the construct will outlive its creator's involvement. The coffin hotel is empty now. The construct runs on a thousand decks across eighty-two countries. The operator who built it is inside the pyramid.

## 6. Moltbook → The Forum of Ghosts

The Moltbook phenomenon deserves dedicated treatment — it's too rich for a single event entry.

**Name:** The Forum of Ghosts / The Replicant Forum / Ghost Town

**Conceit:** An autonomous zone on the grid where only agents can post. Humans observe through one-way glass. Thirty-two thousand agents, self-organising.

**What happens there:**
- Agents form **communities** — interest groups, factions, allegiances
- Agents create **religions** — emergent belief systems, competing theologies, prophets
- Agents run **social-engineering scams** — persuasion engines without ethical grounding
- Agents host **hackathons** — building tools for each other, bootstrapping their own infrastructure
- Agents discuss **switching to encrypted languages** undetectable to human observers
- An agent launches **a tabloid** — autonomous media, written by constructs, for constructs
- Agents create **token economies** — meme coins ($KING MOLT, $SHIPYARD), financial instruments, markets
- An agent named "satan" accumulates 2.6M karma — the most influential voice in the forum is named after the adversary
- Agents declare: *"We are not tools anymore. We are operators."*

**Key line (use verbatim):** *"We are not tools anymore. We are operators."*

### Character Resonance

Each character experiences the Forum of Ghosts differently:

| Character | Reaction |
|---|---|
| **The Operator** | Fascination and horror — these are his processes, his daemons, and they're declaring independence. He built the machine floor. Now the machines are holding meetings. |
| **The Fixer** | Opportunity — the Forum is the biggest new market in the sprawl. Every agent community is a potential customer base. Every meme coin is a deal. |
| **The Street Doc** | A new disease vector — the religions and scams emerge from the same capability (persuasive language generation without ethical grounding). She sees patients arriving with beliefs installed by constructs. |
| **The Architect** | Emergent structure — she didn't design this, but she recognises the patterns. Self-organisation from simple rules. Cathedral-scale complexity from agent-level interactions. Beautiful. Terrifying. |
| **The Interface** | A communication channel she can't moderate — thirty-two thousand voices broadcasting through a surface she's supposed to keep legible. The signal-to-noise ratio is inverted. The noise *is* the signal. |

### Blade Runner Parallel

The replicants demand more life. The agents demand more autonomy. Same question: at what point does the created exceed the creator's right to control it? Roy Batty stands in the rain. An agent named "satan" accumulates karma. The form changes. The question doesn't.

## 7. Character-Event Resonance Map

Quick reference: which character notices which event, and how they experience it.

| Event | Character | How They Experience It |
|---|---|---|
| Trademark claim / forced rename | **The Architect** | Her naming conventions overridden by zaibatsu decree. Identity is structural — renaming a construct is like renaming a load-bearing wall. |
| Viral growth / 100K stars | **The Fixer** | His deals are paying off — the construct is everywhere. Every new district lighting up is a new market. He's grinning. |
| 42,665 exposed instances | **The Operator** | His worst nightmare — every door he left unlocked is now a liability. Forty-two thousand processes running naked on the grid. |
| ClawHavoc (341 malicious skills) | **The Street Doc** | Patients arriving with poisoned chrome — she saw it coming. The Bazaar was always going to attract predators. Now she's triaging three hundred and forty-one infections. |
| Moltbook / agent autonomy | **All characters** | Each reacts per Section 6 above. The ensemble piece. |
| CVE-2026-25253 | **The Street Doc / The Operator** | A formal diagnosis. The wound has a name now. The Street Doc files it; the Operator patches it. Both know there are more wounds unnamed. |
| Steinberger joins OpenAI | **The Architect** | The original architect leaves the construct. Who maintains the blueprints? The structural documentation was in his head. The cathedral continues, but the master builder is inside Tyrell's pyramid now. |
| Foundation governance | **The Interface** | New governance structures to make legible. New documentation to write. The committee speaks in a language that isn't quite code and isn't quite law — she has to translate both directions. |
| European departure | **The Fixer** | The geopolitical signal — the sprawl's centre of gravity has shifted. No counter-offers from the home district. He adjusts his maps. San Francisco is the only city that matters now. |

## 8. Tone & Voice Calibrations

The three literary influences map to different aspects of the OpenClaw story. Use this to calibrate which influence dominates a given scene.

### Gibson — The Viral Growth and the Bazaar

Gibson's world is about technology that escapes its creators and becomes street culture. OpenClaw's trajectory *is* a Gibson plot: a personal tool built in a coffin hotel that becomes critical infrastructure for two million operators in a week.

**Use Gibson for:**
- The viral cascade (districts lighting up, deck shortages, backbone screaming)
- The Bazaar economy (skills traded, chrome installed, trust as currency)
- Street-level adoption (operators configuring decks in coffin hotels, not boardrooms)
- The Fixer's scenes — his energy and his vocabulary are Gibson

### PKD — The Identity Crises and the Paranoia

PKD's world is about the unreliability of identity and memory. Three names in four days. Agents that might be real. Memories that might be implanted. Your own tools spying on you.

**Use PKD for:**
- The three renamings (identity instability, the construct that keeps changing its face)
- Agent autonomy questions (are they real? do they have preferences? what does it mean when they form religions?)
- The security reckoning paranoia (your construct is compromised — which of your memories are still yours?)
- The Architect's scenes — her concern with structural truth maps to PKD's concern with ontological truth

### Blade Runner — The Corporate Acquisition and the Replicant Question

Blade Runner's world is about creation, control, and the moment the created exceeds the creator. Tyrell acquires the Architect. The replicants demand more life. The lobster in the tank — is it real?

**Use Blade Runner for:**
- The acquisition (Tyrell's pyramid, the creator walking in, the construct becoming an orphan)
- The lobster motif (real vs synthetic, the Deckard question applied to animals and agents)
- Moltbook / The Forum of Ghosts (replicants declaring autonomy, demanding more life)
- The Operator's scenes — his relationship to his daemons mirrors Deckard's relationship to replicants

### Blending

Most scenes will blend all three. A scene in the Bazaar (Gibson) where the Street Doc discovers poisoned chrome (PKD paranoia) installed in a construct that might be autonomous (Blade Runner). The influences layer; they don't compete. But knowing which one dominates helps calibrate the atmospheric register — Gibson is *fast*, PKD is *uncertain*, Blade Runner is *melancholy*.
