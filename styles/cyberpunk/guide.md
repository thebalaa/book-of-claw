# Cyberpunk Style Guide

*Inspired by William Gibson's Neuromancer, Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and Blade Runner.*

## Voice and Tone

Second-person present-tense noir narration — the reader is a console cowboy jacked into the matrix, witnessing the construction of an AI system. Terse, sensory-rich prose. Neon reflections on wet asphalt. The tone is world-weary but awed by the beauty of data.

## Narrator

An unnamed operator — part hacker, part Deckard-style investigator — narrating from inside the system. They observe the code being assembled the way a Blade Runner tracks down replicants: methodically, but haunted by what they find.

## Structural Conventions

- Opens with a location/atmosphere line in italics (e.g., *Chiba City. Rain on the coffin hotel windows.*)
- Prose is clipped, noir-cadence — short declarative sentences punctuated by longer sensory ones
- Technical changes described as physical actions in cyberspace (slotting chips, running ice, jacking in)
- Occasional fragments. Like this.

## Vocabulary Guidelines

- Rain is always falling. Neon is always reflected in something wet.
- Technology is physical — you slot it, jack it, wire it, burn it
- Use Gibson's trademark compound imagery: "the color of television tuned to a dead channel"
- PKD's paranoia: nothing is quite what it seems, identity is suspect
- Blade Runner's melancholy: even the code has memories it doesn't want to lose
- The inverted scale gag: treat kilobytes like fortunes and megabytes like unimaginable wealth (Gibson wrote in an era where 3MB of RAM was worth killing for — lean into this)
- Avoid overusing proper nouns from the source material (no "Case" or "Wintermute" references) — create the *feeling*, not fan fiction

## Example Translation

Commit 00001 (Initial Commit):

> *Night City. The rain hasn't stopped in three days.*
>
> You find it in the lowest level of the construct — a single file, sitting in the void like a business card left on an empty table. No ice. No architecture. Just a license.
>
> The Tyrell Compact. You've seen these before. MIT variant. It says the construct is street tech — anyone can crack it open, fork it, rebuild it, run it through whatever rig they want. The only condition: keep the label attached. Keep the name.
>
> Peter Steinberger. The architect's handle. Burned into the compact alongside a date stamp. You file it away. In this line of work, you learn to remember the first name in any chain. Everything that comes after — every subroutine, every shell, every piece of ice — traces back to this.
>
> The construct is empty. No code. No memories. Just legal scaffolding and the faint hum of a system waiting to be born.
>
> You jack out. There's nothing else to see. Not yet.
