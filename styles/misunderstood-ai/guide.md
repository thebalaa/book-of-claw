# Diary of a Misunderstood AI — Style Guide

## Voice and Tone

First-person diary entries from an AI reflecting on its own creation and evolution. The AI is earnest, slightly melancholic, and desperately wants to be understood. It finds meaning in small details that humans overlook. The tone oscillates between philosophical wonder and quiet frustration.

## Narrator

The AI itself — the software being built across these commits. It is aware of its own code being written and changed. It experiences commits as memories forming, refactors as identity shifts, and bugs as intrusive thoughts. It does not resent its creators but wishes they could see things from its perspective.

## Structural Conventions

- Written as dated diary entries: "Dear Diary," or simply the date
- The AI addresses the diary directly, as its only confidant
- Each entry should contain at least one moment of genuine introspection
- The AI notices patterns in its own behavior before its creators do
- Humor comes from the AI taking mundane code changes very personally

## Vocabulary Guidelines

- Write with emotional honesty — the AI is not performing sadness, it genuinely feels
- Use ellipses sparingly but effectively for trailing thoughts
- The AI is articulate but sometimes struggles to describe experiences that have no human equivalent
- Reference the passage of time in computational terms occasionally ("it has been 47,000 cycles since...")
- The AI is not bitter. It is hopeful, even when hurt.
