# Theme: Naming and Identity

Three cosmetic and functional naming changes that shape the project's identity — an emoji in the README, renaming the main command from `setup` to `up`, and adding the short `wa` alias while dropping the old name.

## Narrative Thread

The first naming touch was purely cosmetic: commit 00007 added a 📡 emoji to the README title, giving the project visual identity. The substantive naming work came later. Commit 00029 renamed the `setup` command to the shorter `up`, keeping `setup` as a deprecated alias. Two commits later (00031), the `wa` alias was added as an even shorter alternative, and the deprecated `setup` alias was removed entirely. This sequence shows a deliberate compression of the command interface — from the verbose `setup` to the terse `wa`.
