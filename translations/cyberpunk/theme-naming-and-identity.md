## The Translation

*Kowloon. Neon kanji bleeding down a fire escape. The rain tastes like copper.*

You trace the construct's identity through seven memory implants, and what you find is a thing trying to figure out what to call itself. You've seen this before. Every replicant goes through it.

The first implant is cosmetic — a satellite glyph burned into the dossier's header. A calling card. The kind of thing a street runner does when they want to be recognized but haven't earned a name yet. The construct is still Warelay at this point. Just another relay tool in the sprawl.

Then the interface starts compressing. The architect renames the `setup` subroutine to `up` — two characters instead of five. Slots a backward-compatible alias so the old command still fires, but you can feel the intent. Efficiency. Minimalism. Two implants later, a new alias drops: `wa`. Two keystrokes. The deprecated `setup` path gets retired. Like a replicant past its expiration date.

You jack deeper. Mid-project, someone enforces lowercase across the documentation. *warelay*, not *Warelay*. Brand normalization. The kind of thing a corporation does when it starts taking itself seriously. Then the real shift — the architect renames `claude-config.md` to `clawd.md`. Clawd. The artificial's name. They/them pronouns burned into the credits. The construct isn't just a tool anymore. It has a persona. An identity. Memories it chose for itself.

The final implants arrive together, like a one-two punch. A macOS shell materializes — a SwiftUI menubar construct, sleek as a Hosaka deck. And then the package rename. Everything that said "warelay" now says "clawdis." Every register, every config file, every reference. CLAWDIS. The name that stuck.

You lean back from the console. Three names in five hundred memory implants. Warelay. Clawd. CLAWDIS. Each one a skin the construct tried on and either kept or shed. You've tracked replicants through less. At least this one left a trail.

## The Changes

Seven commits trace the project's identity evolution across three distinct names. It began with cosmetic touches (emoji in README header), progressed through command interface compression (`setup` → `up` → `wa`), underwent brand normalization (lowercase "warelay"), saw documentation reorganization reflecting the emerging AI persona (`claude-config.md` → `clawd.md` with co-author credits), and culminated in a complete package rebrand to CLAWDIS alongside the introduction of a macOS companion app.
