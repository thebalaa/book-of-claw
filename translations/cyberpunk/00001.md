## The Translation

*Night City. The rain hasn't stopped in three days.*

You find it in the lowest level of the construct — a single file, sitting in the void like a business card left on an empty table. No ice. No architecture. Just a license.

The Tyrell Compact. You've seen these before. MIT variant. It says the construct is street tech — anyone can crack it open, fork it, rebuild it, run it through whatever rig they want. The only condition: keep the label attached. Keep the name.

Peter Steinberger. The architect's handle. Burned into the compact alongside a date stamp. You file it away. In this line of work, you learn to remember the first name in any chain. Everything that comes after — every subroutine, every shell, every piece of ice — traces back to this.

The construct is empty. No code. No memories. Just legal scaffolding and the faint hum of a system waiting to be born.

You jack out. There's nothing else to see. Not yet.

## The Changes

The initial commit by Peter Steinberger on 2025-11-24 created the repository with a single file: the MIT License (`LICENSE`). This established the open-source licensing terms for the project — permitting free use, modification, and distribution with the sole condition that the license notice be preserved. No source code was included; this commit laid only the legal foundation.
