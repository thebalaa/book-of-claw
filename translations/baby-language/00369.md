## The Translation

Console output (stuff printed to the screen) wasn't being captured in the log files. Now it is!

Everything gets routed through "pino" (a logging library). This means all output—whether from console.log or the fancy logger—ends up in the same place.

Consistent logging makes debugging easier!

## The Changes

Routes all console output through the pino logger, ensuring consistent logging and capture of all output.
