## The Translation

When the voice forwarding test fails over SSH, "Error" isn't very helpful. What went wrong? Connection refused? Wrong key? Timeout?

Now the error details are surfaced in the Debug panel. You can see exactly what SSH complained about!

## The Changes

Updates `DebugSettings.swift` and `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (2 lines each) to display detailed SSH error messages in voice test.
