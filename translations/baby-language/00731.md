## The Translation

Before, the webchat server would spawn a separate CLI process for each message. That's slow and resource-heavy!

Now it runs the agent "in-process" — same program, no spawning. 31 lines added, 14 removed. Faster and more efficient!

## The Changes

Updates `server.ts` (45 lines changed) to run the agent in-process for RPC instead of spawning CLI.
