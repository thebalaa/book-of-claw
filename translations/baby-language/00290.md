## The Translation

More test isolation! This time, the sessions.json file (which stores who you've been chatting with) was getting touched by tests.

That's dangerous—tests could corrupt your real session data! Now tests use their own fake sessions file, completely separate from production.

Many more tests were updated to be properly isolated. The test helpers got smarter about keeping fake and real data separate.

## The Changes

Fixes tests that were modifying the production sessions.json file. Adds proper test fixtures and isolation to ensure tests never touch real session data. Significantly expands test coverage with new isolated test cases.
