title: "Detecting SSH Tunnel Failures"

## The Translation

If the SSH tunnel exits unexpectedly, the app should know immediately! "Fail fast" means detect problems quickly.

10 lines add detection for when the SSH tunnel exits, so the app can respond appropriately.

## The Changes

Adds fail-fast detection for SSH tunnel exit in `ControlChannel.swift` (12 lines changed, 10 added).
