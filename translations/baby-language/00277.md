## The Translation

Heartbeats got two cool new features!

First: you can now send a custom message with a heartbeat instead of the default one. "Check my calendar" or "Summarize my inbox"—whatever you want!

Second: "dry-run" mode! This lets you test what WOULD happen without actually doing it. It's like a dress rehearsal—you see the whole show but nothing is real. Super helpful for testing!

Both the Web and Twilio providers got these features.

## The Changes

Adds manual message override and dry-run capabilities to heartbeat commands for both web and Twilio providers. Includes comprehensive tests for both features.
