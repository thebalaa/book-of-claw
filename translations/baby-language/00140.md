## The Translation

When something goes wrong, the first question is usually: "What version are you using?" It's like a doctor asking "What did you eat today?" — you need to know the starting point!

The helper robots were having troubles, and we couldn't figure out what version of Node was actually being used. Was it the new one? The old one? Which one?!

So we added "echo" commands that shout out the version numbers BEFORE trying to install anything. Now we can see: "Using Node version 22.latest, npm version X.X." Much easier to debug when you know what you're working with!

## The Changes

Adds version logging to CI workflow before pnpm install. Forces latest Node 22 and echoes Node, npm, and pnpm versions to help diagnose installation issues.
