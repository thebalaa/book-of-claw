title: "Connecting the Debug Button to the Real Logs"

## The Translation

The Debug settings had a "View Logs" button, but it wasn't pointing to the right place! Pino is the logging system that writes detailed logs to a file.

This fix connects the button to the actual pino log file. Now when you click "View Logs," you see the real debug logs instead of... nothing, or the wrong file.

Much more useful for debugging!

## The Changes

Updates `DebugSettings.swift` (11 lines) to link the debug log button to the pino log file location.
