title: "Tracking Token Usage from Logs"

## The Translation

AI APIs charge by "tokens" (pieces of text). Knowing how many tokens you've used is important for cost tracking!

This reads token usage from Pi session logs:
- Parses the log files
- Extracts token counts
- Reports usage statistics

88 new lines add token usage tracking to the status command!

## The Changes

Updates `status.ts` (92 lines changed, 88 new) to read and report token usage from Pi session logs.
