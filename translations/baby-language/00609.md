## The Translation

The relay status label in the menu was a bit verbose. Did you really need all those words every time you looked?

This streamlines it:
- Shorter, clearer labels
- Still shows the essential info
- Less visual clutter

11 new lines make the menu bar feel tidier!

## The Changes

Updates `MenuBar.swift` (11 lines) to display a more streamlined relay status label with clearer, more concise text.
