## The Translation

The Pi agent now receives its prompts through "stdin" (standard input—like typing into a program's keyboard).

This is a different way of passing data that works better for the RPC setup. The data flows in smoothly!

## The Changes

Routes Pi agent prompts via RPC stdin for improved prompt handling.
