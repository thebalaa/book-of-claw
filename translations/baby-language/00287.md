title: "Tests That Don't Peek at Your Secrets"

## The Translation

Uh oh! The tests were accidentally loading the real user's config file. That's not good—tests should use fake data, not your actual settings!

This fix adds "test isolation." Now tests create their own pretend config instead of peeking at the real one. Your secrets stay safe, and tests are more reliable.

It's like making sure kids doing homework use example problems, not their parents' actual bank information!

## The Changes

Fixes test isolation to prevent tests from loading real user configuration files. Test helpers now create isolated mock configurations to ensure consistent, safe testing.
