title: "Making XPC and Voice Wake More Reliable"

## The Translation

XPC is how different parts of the app talk to each other. Voice Wake is how it listens for your wake words. Both were having some stability issues.

This commit is like a tune-up for a car — tightening bolts, adjusting timing, making sure everything runs smoothly:

- MenuBar gets 10 lines for better state handling
- Permission checks get refined
- Voice Wake settings get 30 lines of improvements
- CLI gets reorganized (69 lines)
- Restart script gets simplified (47 fewer lines!)

The result: fewer crashes, more reliable behavior.

## The Changes

Stabilizes XPC communication and voice wake handling across multiple files. Simplifies the restart script. Improves error handling and state management throughout the voice wake system.
