<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00067-d0c9bff4ca-Ignore coverage output and document Claude text mode-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added coverage output files to .gitignore so they don't get accidentally committed to version control. Coverage files are generated by tests but shouldn't be saved in git.

He also documented how Claude text mode works in the code comments.

It's like telling git "ignore the scratch paper, only save the final report."

## The Changes

This commit improved gitignore and docs:

- Added coverage/ directory to .gitignore
- Documented Claude text mode behavior
- Added inline comments explaining output format handling
- Prevented test artifacts from polluting git

Test outputs are now properly excluded from version control.
