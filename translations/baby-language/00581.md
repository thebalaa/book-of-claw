title: "You Must Sign Your App Now"

## The Translation

Before, signing the app was optional. You could use ad-hoc signing (temporary) or your real developer certificate. But ad-hoc signing causes problems with permissions!

This change makes signing identity REQUIRED. You can't package the app without setting up proper code signing. It's like saying "no unsigned packages allowed in the mail" — everything must have a proper stamp.

The script will now error out if you don't provide `SIGN_IDENTITY`, forcing you to do it right the first time.

## The Changes

Updates `codesign-mac-app.sh` (34 lines) and `package-mac-app.sh` to require a signing identity. Removes the ad-hoc fallback option.
