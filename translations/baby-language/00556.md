title: "Making Sure Permissions Are Really Checked"

## The Translation

The previous commit added permission checking for voice wake, but there was a small gap. This quick 3-line fix makes sure the permission gate is complete — no sneaking through without proper microphone access!

It's like adding an extra lock on the door. The feature won't work unless you have the right key (permission).

## The Changes

Adds 3 lines to `VoiceWakeSettings.swift` to ensure voice wake permissions are properly gated. Completes the permission checking started in the previous commit.
