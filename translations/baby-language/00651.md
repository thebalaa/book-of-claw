title: "A Local Web Server for the Chat"

## The Translation

Web browsers have strict security rules about loading files. When the chat window tried to load local JavaScript modules, the browser said "CORS error! You can't do that!"

The solution: run a tiny web server locally! Instead of loading files directly, the chat window now connects to `localhost:port` and the server serves the files. The browser is happy because it's a "real" web page now.

161 lines of new WebChatServer code handle all the serving.

## The Changes

Adds `WebChatServer.swift` (161 lines) to serve web chat assets via localhost, avoiding CORS restrictions. Updates `WebChatWindow.swift` to use the server.
