## The Translation

A CNAME file tells the web where your site lives. This lets the documentation have a nice custom domain name!

Instead of some ugly GitHub URL, the docs can have a friendly address. One tiny file, big improvement for users finding the docs.

## The Changes

Creates CNAME file for custom domain configuration of the documentation site.
