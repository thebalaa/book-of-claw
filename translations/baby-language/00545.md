## The Translation

What if you could say "Hey Clawdis" on your laptop, but have it control a different computer? Like having a remote control that works through the internet!

This feature is called "SSH forwarding." SSH is a secure tunnel between computers — like a secret passage. When you detect a wake word on your Mac, instead of just running locally, you can forward that command to another machine.

This commit adds:
- A place to save the SSH target (the other computer's address)
- A `VoiceWakeForwarder` that handles the tunnel
- Settings UI to configure where to forward commands

Now your Mac can be like a voice-activated remote control for your server or another computer!

## The Changes

Adds SSH forward target functionality to Voice Wake. Creates `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (121 lines) for handling SSH connections. Extends `AppState` with SSH target storage. Adds UI in `VoiceWakeSettings` to configure the forwarding destination.
