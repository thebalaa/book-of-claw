## The Translation

When you log out of something, it should clean up after itself. This change makes sure the session store (where conversation info is saved) gets purged when you log out.

It's like cleaning your room before you leave on vacation—don't leave a mess behind! Old session data shouldn't stick around after logout.

## The Changes

Adds session store cleanup during logout, purging stored session data to ensure no stale information remains after a user logs out.
