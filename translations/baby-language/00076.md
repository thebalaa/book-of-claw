<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00076-a89d7319a9-refactor- modularize cli helpers-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter extracted CLI helper functions into their own module. Functions that support the command-line interface but aren't commands themselves now have a dedicated home.

The refactoring continues - every piece finding its proper place.

## The Changes

- Created CLI helpers module
- Moved supporting functions
- Improved code organization
- Better module separation

CLI support code is now cleanly separated.
