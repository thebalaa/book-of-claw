## The Translation

When you change how something works, you need to update the instructions!

The relay (the messenger program) used to be managed by a separate system service on your Mac (called launchd). But now it runs right inside the Clawdis app itself — as a "child process" connected to the menu bar toggle.

The old instructions said to use special commands to restart the relay. But those don't work anymore! Now you just:
1. Quit the Clawdis app
2. Open it again

Or run a helper script called `scripts/restart-mac.sh`.

This commit updates the `AGENTS.md` file (the instruction manual for developers) to explain the new way. It's important to keep instructions up-to-date, otherwise people get confused and try old commands that don't work!

## The Changes

Updates `AGENTS.md` to reflect the new relay management approach: relay now runs as a child process inside the Mac app (tied to the menu bar toggle) rather than as a launchd service. Documents the new restart procedure: quit/reopen the app or use `scripts/restart-mac.sh`.
