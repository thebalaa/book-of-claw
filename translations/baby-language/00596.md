title: "Checking if the RPC Worker is Alive"

## The Translation

How do you know if the phone line is working? You check if someone picks up!

This adds an RPC "status" command:
- Ask "are you there?"
- Get back "yes, I'm running!"

Plus tests to make sure it works. Now you can check if the RPC worker is healthy before trying to send messages. If it's not running, you'll know right away instead of messages disappearing into the void.

## The Changes

Adds RPC status command and tests across 5 files (54 lines total). Includes AgentRPC status method, XPC/IPC protocol updates, CLI command, and unit tests.
