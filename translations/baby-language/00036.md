<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00036-b4a995dbe5-Document config options and log auto-reply timing-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added documentation for all the config options and started logging how long auto-replies take.

The documentation explains all the settings you can put in your `~/.warelay/warelay.json` file: what modes are available (text or command), what fields you can use, how templates work, and how the allowlist protects you.

He also added timing logs. Now when an auto-reply runs, it logs how long the command took: "Command auto-reply took 1.23s". This is helpful for debugging slow responses or noticing when something hangs.

It's like adding both an instruction manual (documentation) and a stopwatch (timing) to the auto-reply system.

## The Changes

This commit documented the config format and added timing:

- Added detailed comments in code explaining the WarelayConfig structure
- Added timing measurement: records start time, calculates duration after command completes
- Logs "Command auto-reply took Xs" in verbose mode
- Clarified allowlist behavior in comments

Users can now understand what config options are available and see how long their auto-reply commands take.
