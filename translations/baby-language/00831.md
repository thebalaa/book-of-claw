## The Translation

When health checks fail, you need details! Not just "unhealthy" but WHY.

43 new lines add detailed failure display:
- GeneralSettings shows more info (36 lines)
- HealthStore provides details (15 lines)

Better debugging when things go wrong!

## The Changes

Adds detailed health failure display to `GeneralSettings.swift` (36 lines) and `HealthStore.swift` (15 lines).
