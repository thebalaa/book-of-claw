<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00019-eb1c4ae7cf-Fix Twilio sender list call -use params instead of qs-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter fixed a tiny bug in how the program talks to Twilio's API. When asking Twilio "Hey, show me my WhatsApp senders," the program was using the wrong format for the question.

It was using `qs` (query string) when it should have been using `params` (parameters). These are two slightly different ways to attach extra information to a request. Think of it like addressing a letter - both ways might work, but one is the official format Twilio expects.

This is a one-word change: `qs:` became `params:`. But that one word matters! Using the right format means Twilio understands the request properly.

Peter also cleaned up the formatting of the code a bit, spreading the type definition across multiple lines so it's easier to read. No behavior change, just making the code prettier.

## The Changes

This commit fixed the API parameter format:

- Changed `qs: { Channel: 'whatsapp', PageSize: 50 }` to `params: { Channel: 'whatsapp', PageSize: 50 }`
- Reformatted the type cast for the request function across multiple lines for readability

The `qs` (query string) parameter was likely working but `params` is the correct/standard way to pass GET parameters in the Twilio client's request format.
