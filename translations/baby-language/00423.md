## The Translation

If a message has both a directive AND a question, both should work! "/verbose what's the weather?" should turn on verbose AND ask about weather.

This fix allows inline directives to continue processing the rest of the message.

## The Changes

Allows inline directives to continue processing remainder of message, with mixed-message test.
