## The Translation

The project should work with both Node.js AND Bun. CI should test both!

38 new lines add Bun runtime testing to the CI workflow alongside Node. More coverage, more confidence!

## The Changes

Updates `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (42 lines changed) to test both Node and Bun runtimes.
