## The Translation

When you're writing a diary, sometimes you flip to tomorrow's page and write the date even though nothing's happened yet. You're getting ready!

We reorganized the CHANGELOG (our diary of changes) and added a placeholder for version 0.1.3. It says "[Unreleased]" because we haven't shipped it yet, but we're setting up the page for when we do.

It's good housekeeping. Now when we make changes, we know exactly where to write them down. The 0.1.3 section is ready and waiting for new features!

## The Changes

Reorders CHANGELOG entries and adds a stub section for the upcoming 0.1.3 release. Prepares the changelog structure for future development.
