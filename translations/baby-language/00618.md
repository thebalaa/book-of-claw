title: "Nevermind! Undoing the Auto-Start"

## The Translation

Sometimes you try something and it doesn't work as expected. The auto-start feature was causing problems!

This "revert" commit takes back the previous change. It's like pressing Ctrl+Z — undo! The code goes back to how it was before.

This is normal in software development. Try something, see if it works, undo if it doesn't.

## The Changes

Reverts the auto-start RPC worker changes from the previous commit. Returns `AgentRPC.swift` and `Constants.swift` to their prior state.
