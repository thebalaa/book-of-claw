## The Translation

Running health checks on a remote server was failing because the shell environment wasn't right. The fix:
- Use zsh (the default shell on modern macOS)
- Use pnpm to run the health command

9 lines make remote health checks work properly on typical setups.

## The Changes

Updates `Utilities.swift` (16 lines changed) to run remote health commands with pnpm under zsh shell.
