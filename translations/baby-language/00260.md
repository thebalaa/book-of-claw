## The Translation

Some people want a dedicated phone number just for their AI assistant—separate from their personal number. This change explains how to set that up!

It's called a "two-phone setup." One phone is your regular personal phone. The other phone (or a second SIM card) runs the AI assistant.

The documentation now walks you through this, explaining the pros and cons. If you don't want people messaging your AI on your personal number, this is the way to do it!

## The Changes

Adds documentation explaining how to set up a dedicated AI phone number using a two-phone configuration, including guidance on SIM cards, eSIMs, and separating personal from AI messaging.
