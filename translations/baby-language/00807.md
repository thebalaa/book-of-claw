## The Translation

The overlay shows your words, but what about showing the audio level? A level meter!

42 new lines add a visual level meter:
- Shows how loud you're speaking
- Animates with your voice
- Feedback that the mic is working

## The Changes

Adds level meter to `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (36 lines) with runtime support (6 lines).
