## The Translation

The display label was using a custom color. But macOS has a "primary text color" that adapts to light/dark mode automatically!

One line switches to the primary text color. Now it looks right in all modes.

## The Changes

Uses primary text color for display label in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (1 line changed).
