## The Translation

Remember that new "don't repeat yourself" feature we just added? Well, a good builder always checks their work!

Think of it like building a LEGO tower. After you add each piece, you give it a little wiggle to make sure it's actually stuck on properly. That's what tests do—they wiggle the code to make sure it really works.

This change adds a test that pretends to be a user talking to the system. It checks: "When I haven't told the system anything special, does it behave normally?" It makes sure the new memory feature doesn't accidentally break anything for people who don't even know it exists.

It's like making sure a new toy still works even if you never read the instruction manual.

## The Changes

Adds test coverage for the `sendSystemOnce` feature's default behavior. The test verifies that when `sendSystemOnce` is not configured (the default), the system prompt is included on every turn as expected, ensuring backwards compatibility.
