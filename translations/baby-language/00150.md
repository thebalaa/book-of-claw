## The Translation

Sometimes you don't just clean your room — you deep clean the WHOLE HOUSE. Every drawer, every shelf, under the beds, everywhere!

This commit is like that. TWENTY-SIX files got updated! That's a lot. But it's not new features — it's making the existing code better organized.

Think of it like rearranging furniture so the room flows better, labeling all your containers, and making sure everything is where it should be. The code does the same things as before, but now it's tidier and easier to work with. Future-you will thank present-you!

## The Changes

Major code sync and refactoring across 26 source files. Reorganizes imports, improves code structure, and standardizes patterns throughout the codebase. Net result: cleaner, more maintainable code.
