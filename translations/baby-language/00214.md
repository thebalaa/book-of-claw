## The Translation

There's that organizing bug again! The builder keeps finding big messy files and splitting them into neat smaller ones.

This time it's the "reply" code—the part that figures out how to respond to messages. It was getting really long, with too many different jobs crammed into one file.

Now it's split up:
- One file handles running commands (like when the computer needs to ask another program for help)
- One file handles turning voice messages into text (transcription)
- One file keeps shared definitions (types)

Each piece has its own home now. Much easier to find things and fix them when something goes wrong!

## The Changes

Refactors the reply module by extracting command execution logic into `command-reply.ts` and audio transcription handling into `transcription.ts`. Creates a shared `types.ts` for common type definitions. The main `reply.ts` becomes a coordinator that uses these smaller, focused modules.
