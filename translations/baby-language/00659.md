## The Translation

When voice wake detects your trigger phrase and transcribes what you said, that text needs to go to the remote computer. Before, it wasn't being passed along properly.

Now the transcript (what you said) gets "piped" through the SSH connection to the remote Clawdis instance. Your voice command actually arrives!

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (10 lines changed) to pipe the transcript text through the SSH forwarder.
