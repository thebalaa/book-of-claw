<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00108-9bf35d3272-fix- harden MEDIA parsing and add tests-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made media URL parsing more robust and added additional tests. The parser now handles edge cases and malformed URLs gracefully.

It's defensive programming - assuming inputs might be weird and handling them safely.

## The Changes

- Hardened media URL parsing logic
- Added edge case handling
- More comprehensive tests
- Safer media processing

Media parsing is now more robust against unexpected inputs.
