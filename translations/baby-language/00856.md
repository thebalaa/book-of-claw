## The Translation

Push-to-talk: what happens when you release the key? Now it either:
- Sends (if there's content)
- Dismisses (if empty)

16 lines added, 9 removed. More intuitive PTT behavior!

## The Changes

Adds send-or-dismiss on release for PTT in VoicePushToTalk (17 lines), overlay (6 lines), and runtime (2 lines).
