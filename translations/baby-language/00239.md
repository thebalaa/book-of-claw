## The Translation

People have different ways of identifying contacts. Some use phone numbers (like +1234567890), some use WhatsApp internal IDs, and some might use special labels starting with @lid.

This change teaches the system to understand the @lid format. It's like learning that "Mom" and "Mother" and "555-1234" all mean the same person.

There's also a fix for the "allowFrom" setting—when you say "allow messages from anyone," the wildcard (*) now works correctly. Before, it might have been too picky!

## The Changes

Adds support for the `@lid` contact identifier format and fixes wildcard handling in the `allowFrom` configuration. The system can now correctly parse and normalize various contact ID formats and properly handle the `*` wildcard for allowing all senders.
