<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00103-a9533d099-chore: add connection/send logs and web error surfacing-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made two improvements to help people understand what's happening.

**First improvement:** When you start sending a message, the program now says "🔌 Connecting to WhatsApp Web…" — like announcing "I'm picking up the phone" before you make a call. Before, it just quietly connected. Now you know it's working on it.

**Second improvement:** If something goes wrong when sending a message, the program now catches the mistake (the error) and shows you a friendly message: "❌ Web send failed" plus what went wrong. Before, if sending failed, you might see a confusing error. Now it's wrapped in a clear explanation.

Think of it like a helpful friend who says "Oops, that didn't work because..." instead of just shrugging.

Two files changed, 14 lines added, 8 removed. Small changes, but they make the program much easier to understand when things go right — and especially when things go wrong.

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger modified `src/provider-web.ts` and `src/commands/send.ts` on November 25, 2025. In the web provider, he added a "🔌 Connecting to WhatsApp Web…" log message before the connection attempt. In the send command, he wrapped the `sendMessageWeb()` call in a `.catch()` handler that logs "❌ Web send failed: [error]" before re-throwing. This surfaces errors to users in a readable format rather than letting raw exceptions bubble up. Net change: +14 lines, -8 lines across 2 files.
