## The Translation

Peter improved logging around connections and message sending. The web provider now logs connection status changes and surfaces errors more clearly.

Better visibility into what the program is doing helps with troubleshooting.

## The Changes

- Added connection status logging
- Improved send operation logging
- Better error surfacing for web provider
- More informative logs overall

Connection and send operations now have clear, informative logging.
