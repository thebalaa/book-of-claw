title: "Starting the RPC Worker Automatically"

## The Translation

If the RPC worker isn't running when you try to send a message, what should happen? This fix makes it auto-start!

- Agent call comes in
- RPC worker not running? Start it!
- Then send the message

No more "worker not running" errors. Self-healing!

## The Changes

Adds auto-start logic to `AgentRPC.swift` (15 lines) to launch the RPC worker if not running when agent calls arrive.
