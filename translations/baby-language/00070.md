<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00070-b8b0873c1e-Extract auto-reply helpers into modules-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter moved all the auto-reply helper functions into their own module files. Instead of having auto-reply code scattered throughout the main file, it's now organized in dedicated modules.

This continues the modularization trend - breaking the big monolithic codebase into smaller, focused pieces.

It's like organizing your closet by putting all shoes together, all shirts together, all pants together - instead of everything mixed up.

## The Changes

This commit modularized auto-reply code:

- Created src/auto-reply/ directory
- Moved auto-reply logic to dedicated modules
- Extracted config loading, template processing, and command execution
- Improved code organization and testability

Auto-reply functionality is now cleanly separated and independently testable.
