## The Translation

Agent events are now typed from the gateway through to the Mac app! No more loose typing.

19 lines added, 22 removed. Cleaner, type-safe event handling throughout.

## The Changes

Types agent events end-to-end in AgentEventsWindow (3 lines) and ControlChannel (39 lines changed).
