## The Translation

When SSH fails, there are specific problems to catch:
- Missing SSH key
- No output from remote command
- Connection refused

This adds 7 lines to detect and report these specific issues. Now you know exactly what went wrong!

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (9 lines changed) to surface specific SSH failures like missing key or no output.
