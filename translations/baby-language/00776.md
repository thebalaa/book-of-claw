title: "Simpler Restart Script"

## The Translation

The restart script was using the launch agent to restart the app. That's overly complex! Just launch the app directly.

35 lines removed, 3 added. Much simpler approach that just works!

## The Changes

Simplifies `restart-mac.sh` (38 lines changed) to launch app directly instead of using launch agent.
