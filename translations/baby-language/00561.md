title: "Keeping the Test Card from Jumping Around"

## The Translation

Have you ever clicked a button and the whole page jumped because something changed size? Annoying, right?

The SSH test card was doing this — when the test results appeared, the card would resize and push other things around. These 2 lines fix a minimum height so the card stays the same size whether it's showing results or not.

No more jumping!

## The Changes

Adds 2 lines to `VoiceWakeSettings.swift` to set a minimum height on the test card, preventing layout jumps when test results appear.
