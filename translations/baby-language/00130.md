## The Translation

Remember how we've been wrestling with getting the right version of Node? It's like trying to get the right size batteries for a toy — 22.9.0 didn't work, 20.18.0 had issues, and now we're trying 22.21.1!

The problem is that when you install Node, you have to make sure the computer KNOWS where to find it. It's like putting a flashlight in a drawer but telling everyone "the flashlight is on the table." They'll never find it!

We added 15 more lines to make absolutely sure our custom Node installation is found FIRST, before any other version. We're basically shouting: "USE THIS ONE!" and pointing very clearly.

## The Changes

Updates CI workflow to forcefully set PATH to use custom Node 22.21.1 before pnpm runs. Ensures the manually installed Node version takes precedence over any system-installed versions.
