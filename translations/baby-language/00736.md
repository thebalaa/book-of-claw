## The Translation

Attachments needed more work:
- Cap the size (don't allow giant files!)
- Persist them to disk (save for later)
- Strip data URLs (clean up after saving)

66 lines added, 10 removed. Robust attachment handling that won't crash with big files!

## The Changes

Updates `server.ts` (76 lines changed) to cap attachment sizes, persist to disk, and strip data URLs.
