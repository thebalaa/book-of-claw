<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00088-39cd9bde1f-chore- route exec logging through logger-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter migrated command execution logging to use the logger. When the program runs external commands (like for auto-replies), those logs now go through the centralized logger.

The logger migration continues - getting closer to 100% logger coverage!

## The Changes

- Updated command execution to use logger
- Migrated exec-related console statements
- Consistent logging for spawned processes

Command execution now uses the unified logging system.
