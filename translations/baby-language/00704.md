title: "Stopping the Voice Wake Tester Properly"

## The Translation

The voice wake tester would keep listening even after you said the trigger phrase! It should stop after a short silence.

7 lines added, 5 removed. Now when you test voice wake, it stops listening shortly after it hears the trigger. More natural behavior!

## The Changes

Fixes `VoiceWakeTester.swift` (12 lines changed) to stop after a short post-trigger silence period.
