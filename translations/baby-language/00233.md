title: "Even More Heartbeat Logging"

## The Translation

The builder is really making sure heartbeats are easy to debug! This change adds even more detailed logging about what's happening during heartbeat processing.

Now you can see exactly what the system is thinking: "Checking if Alice's session is too old... nope, still fresh. Checking Bob's... that one expired."

It's like having a narrator for a cooking show who explains every step: "Now we're adding the eggs... now we're stirring gently..."

More logging means fewer mysteries when something goes wrong!

## The Changes

Enhances heartbeat logging with verbose session state information, providing detailed traces of session freshness checks and decision-making during heartbeat processing.
