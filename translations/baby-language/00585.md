title: "Testing the Cache for Remote CLI Paths"

## The Translation

When we find where the CLI is on a remote machine, we remember it (cache it) so we don't have to search again. But is the caching working correctly?

These tests verify:
- The cache stores the path after finding it
- The cache is used on subsequent lookups
- The cache can be cleared if needed

More test coverage = more confidence that things work!

## The Changes

Adds 29 lines of tests for the CLI path caching in `VoiceWakeForwarderTests.swift`. Also adds 11 lines to the forwarder to support testing.
