## The Translation

Okay, so we can transcribe audio. But where does that text GO? We need to weave it into the conversation naturally!

Before: "User sent a voice message" (Claude: "I have no idea what they said")
After: "User said: 'What's the weather today?'" (Claude: "I can help with that!")

We created proper documentation about audio (a whole new `audio.md` file!), and improved how transcripts appear in prompts. Now when someone sends a voice message, Claude actually knows what they said and can respond helpfully!

## The Changes

Surfaces audio transcripts into Claude prompts. Adds audio.md documentation explaining the feature. Updates templating to include transcribed text in the conversation context.
