## The Translation

Polling (checking repeatedly) for updates is okay, but WebSockets are better! They push updates instantly when something changes.

231 new lines add WebSocket support:
- Server broadcasts updates
- Client receives them immediately
- No more polling delays

True real-time webchat updates!

## The Changes

Adds WebSocket push updates to `bootstrap.js` (83 lines), bundle (73 lines), and `server.ts` (134 lines). Adds ws package.
