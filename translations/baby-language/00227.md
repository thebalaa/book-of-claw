## The Translation

The changelog is like a book with chapters for each version. When you're working on new features that aren't released yet, you need a place to write them down!

This change opens a new section in the changelog called "1.1.x Unreleased"—it's like starting a fresh page where you can list all the exciting things being built before they're officially released.

As features get finished, they'll get noted here. When it's time to release, this section becomes the official release notes!

## The Changes

Creates a new "Unreleased" section in the changelog for version 1.1.x development, providing a place to document upcoming changes before the next release is finalized.
