<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00035-42f64279d5-Add claude auto-reply allowlist and verbose hooks-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a way to make auto-replies safer when using Claude (an AI assistant). Now you can configure an allowlist in your settings - a list of phone numbers that are allowed to trigger AI auto-replies.

Think of it like a VIP list at a club. Only the phone numbers on your allowlist can get AI-generated responses. Everyone else is ignored (or you can configure a different type of reply for them).

This is important for security - you don't want random people sending messages to your WhatsApp and having an AI respond on your behalf without limits. The allowlist lets you control exactly who can interact with your AI auto-reply system.

## The Changes

This commit added allowlist support for command-based auto-replies:

- Added `allowlist` field to config types (array of phone numbers)
- Added check in `getReplyFromConfig()` to verify sender is in allowlist before running commands
- Added verbose logging when sender is not on allowlist
- Improved verbose logging hooks throughout the auto-reply flow

Now only whitelisted phone numbers can trigger command-based auto-replies, providing security for AI-powered responses.
