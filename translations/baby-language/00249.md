## The Translation

Remember how we made the system prompt only send once? Well, there was another piece that needed the same treatment!

The Claude prompt (the special introduction for the AI) was being prepended every single turn. Now it only appears on the first turn of a conversation.

It's like meeting someone: you introduce yourself once at the beginning, then you just talk normally. You don't say "Hi, my name is Claude" every single sentence!

## The Changes

Modifies the command-reply logic to only prepend the Claude identity/context prompt on the first turn of a session, similar to the sendSystemOnce behavior. Adds tests verifying the prompt is only included initially.
