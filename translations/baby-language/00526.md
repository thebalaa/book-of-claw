## The Translation

Have you ever had a REALLY messy room where everything was piled in one spot? Finding your homework, your toys, and your art supplies all in one big heap is hard!

The main file for the Mac app (AppMain.swift) had gotten really messy — almost 4,000 lines of code all in one file! That's like having everything you own stuffed in one closet.

This commit is like organizing that room. Each type of thing gets its own drawer:
- **AboutSettings** — The "about this app" info
- **AppState** — What the app is currently doing
- **MenuBar** — The little icon and menu at the top of your screen
- **Onboarding** — The welcome tutorial for new users
- **PermissionManager** — Asking for permission to use your mic, etc.
- **VoiceWakeSettings** — Settings for "Hey Clawdis!"

Now instead of one giant messy file, there are 22 smaller, organized files. Each one does one thing well. Much easier to find stuff!

## The Changes

Splits the 3,683-line `AppMain.swift` into 22 focused modules: AboutSettings, AppState, ConfigSettings, Constants, DebugSettings, GeneralSettings, MenuBar, ModelCatalogLoader, NotificationManager, Onboarding, PermissionManager, PermissionsSettings, Screenshotter, SessionData, SessionsSettings, SettingsComponents, SettingsRootView, ShellRunner, Utilities, VoiceWakeSettings, XPCService. Each file handles one area of functionality.
