## The Translation

Have you ever written something and then realized "I used too many words"? Good writing is often about cutting things down!

The 0.1.2 changelog entry had one line that wasn't really needed. Maybe it said something twice, or included unnecessary detail. Either way — snip! Gone!

One line removed. The changelog is now cleaner and more focused. Sometimes less really is more. Your readers will thank you for not making them read extra fluff!

## The Changes

Trims the 0.1.2 changelog entry by removing one unnecessary line. Keeps the documentation concise and focused.
