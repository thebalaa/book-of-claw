## The Translation

In group chats, people @mention with phone numbers. The AI needs to recognize "hey, that number is ME!"

This fix detects when the AI's phone number is mentioned, so it knows to respond. Otherwise, it would ignore messages meant for it.

Self-awareness is important!

## The Changes

Fixes detection of self-number mentions in group chats, ensuring the AI recognizes when it's being directly addressed.
