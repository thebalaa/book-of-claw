title: "Array Handling for Both Providers"

## The Translation

Both Twilio and Web providers need to handle array replies the same way. This change makes sure they're both on the same page!

When a heartbeat returns multiple messages, both providers now know how to send them all. No special handling needed—they both do the right thing.

## The Changes

Normalizes array reply handling for both Twilio and Web providers to ensure consistent behavior when processing multi-message heartbeat responses.
