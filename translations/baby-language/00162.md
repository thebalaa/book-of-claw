## The Translation

Remember that `up` command we kept as an alias? Well... we decided we don't need it after all!

It's like putting up a sign, then taking it down, then putting it back up, then taking it down again. Sometimes you need to try things to figure out what works best.

We removed 39 lines of code for the deprecated `up` alias and updated all the docs to point people to the new, correct way of doing things. Cleaner code, cleaner docs. Sometimes the best code is no code at all!

## The Changes

Removes the deprecated `up` command alias and updates documentation across multiple files to reflect the new ingress setup. Net reduction of 54 lines.
