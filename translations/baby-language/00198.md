## The Translation

Have you ever read instructions that almost made sense, but you needed them to be just a LITTLE clearer? Like "add water" when you need to know "add 2 cups of water"?

The transcript feature was documented, but some parts needed polish. Which settings control transcription? How does the transcript appear in the prompt? The docs weren't crystal clear.

Three lines changed across three files. Small tweaks, but important ones. Now when people want to use audio transcription, the instructions won't leave them guessing!

## The Changes

Clarifies documentation around transcript prompts and configuration. Updates changelog, README, and config docs with improved explanations for the audio feature.
