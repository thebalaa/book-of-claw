## The Translation

Imagine you build a beautiful house, but the front door is stuck! People can't get in. All that work, and the entrance doesn't work!

When people install our package from npm, they type a command to run it. But the command wasn't working! The file that's supposed to start everything (the "bin" entry point) wasn't properly invoking the program.

We fixed it! Added a new file called `warelay.js` that properly starts things up. Now when people type the command, it actually RUNS. Kind of important for a CLI tool, wouldn't you say?

## The Changes

Fixes the CLI bin entry point to properly invoke the program parser. Adds warelay.js bin script and adjusts package.json to point to the correct executable.
