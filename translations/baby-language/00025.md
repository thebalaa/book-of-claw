<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00025-5fcbd6aadc-Run CLI via tsx -no build required- note in README-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the program easier to run for developers. Before, you had to build the program first (turn TypeScript into JavaScript) before you could use it. Now you can run it directly!

He did this using a tool called `tsx` - it reads TypeScript files and runs them on the fly, without needing to build them first. It's like reading a recipe and cooking at the same time, instead of copying the recipe into English and then cooking.

The changes in package.json show this:
- `"start"` used to run `node dist/index.js` (the built version)
- Now it runs `tsx src/index.ts` (the TypeScript source directly)

Same for the `warelay` and `warely` shortcuts - they all use tsx now.

The README was updated too: building is now optional. For local development, you don't need to run `pnpm build` anymore. You can just use `pnpm start` or `pnpm warelay` and it works right away.

This makes development much faster. Change code, run it, see the result - no build step in between.

## The Changes

This commit enabled running the CLI without a build step:

- Changed npm scripts (`start`, `warelay`, `warely`) from running `node dist/index.js` to running `tsx src/index.ts`
- Updated README setup instructions: building is now optional ("scripts run directly via tsx, no build required for local use")
- The `dev` script already used tsx, now all the other scripts do too

This means developers can run the CLI immediately after making changes without waiting for a TypeScript compilation step. Building is still available but only needed for distribution.
