## The Translation

The Quit button in General Settings was right at the bottom edge — a bit cramped. Adding a tiny bit of space (inset) makes it breathe.

One line for a small but nice visual improvement!

## The Changes

Adds 1 line to `GeneralSettings.swift` for bottom inset below the quit button.
