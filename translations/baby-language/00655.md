## The Translation

The web chat window needs the local server to be running before it can load. But what if it tries to load before the server starts?

This adds:
- Waiting for the server to be ready
- Debug logging so you can see what's happening

22 new lines make the startup more reliable!

## The Changes

Updates `WebChatServer.swift` (5 lines) and `WebChatWindow.swift` (18 lines) to wait for server readiness and add debug logging.
