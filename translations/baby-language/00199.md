## The Translation

We handled images. We added audio transcription. But what about VIDEOS? What about DOCUMENTS? What about all the other stuff people might send?

This commit goes bigger! We added support for:
- **Audio** — transcribe voice messages
- **Video** — handle video files too
- **Documents** — PDFs, Word docs, you name it

We created a new file `media/constants.ts` that knows about all these different types. 147 new lines of code! Now we can handle all sorts of media, not just pictures. The system is becoming much more versatile!

## The Changes

Adds support for audio, video, and document media types with configurable caps. Creates media constants module and enhances transcript context handling. Comprehensive feature expansion.
