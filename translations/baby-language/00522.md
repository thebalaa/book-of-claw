## The Translation

Words matter! The setting was called "Relay project root" but that's kind of confusing. What's a relay? What's a root?

Changing it to "Clawdis project root" is much clearer. Now when you see that setting, you know exactly what it means: the folder where your Clawdis project lives.

It's a tiny change — just swapping a few words — but it makes the app friendlier. Like changing a street sign from "Arterial Throughway 7B" to "Main Street."

## The Changes

Renames the Debug settings label from "Relay project root" to "Clawdis project root" for clarity. A one-line text change.
