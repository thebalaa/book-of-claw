title: "Don't Crash if Cleanup Has Nothing to Clean"

## The Translation

Imagine you're told to clean your room, but your room is already clean. Do you freak out? No, you just say "Already clean!" and move on.

The restart script had a "clean" step that would fail if there was nothing to clean (like no old processes running). This tiny one-line fix makes that step "resilient" — it shrugs and continues instead of failing.

It's a defensive fix: the script now works whether there's stuff to clean up or not.

## The Changes

Updates `restart-mac.sh` clean step to not fail when there are no processes to kill. Uses `|| true` or similar to make the step always succeed.
