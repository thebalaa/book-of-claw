title: "Moving Technical Settings to Debug"

## The Translation

The session store path is a technical setting — most users don't need to change it. Having it in the main Config settings was cluttering things up.

This moves it to the Debug tab where it belongs. Debug settings are for power users who know what they're doing. Regular users get a cleaner Config tab.

97 lines added to Debug, 38 lines removed from Config. Better organization!

## The Changes

Moves session store path setting from `ConfigSettings.swift` to `DebugSettings.swift`. Reduces Config clutter for regular users while keeping the option accessible in Debug.
