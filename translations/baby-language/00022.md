<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00022-efe0a76703-Use Twilio SDK channelsSenders-list to discover sender-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter switched to using Twilio's official helper function instead of making his own custom request. It's like using a pre-made cake mix instead of measuring out flour and sugar yourself.

Before, the program was manually building a request to Twilio's API (like writing a letter by hand). Now it uses Twilio's SDK method: `client.messaging.v2.channelsSenders.list()` - a pre-made function that does the same thing but is officially supported.

The tricky part: Twilio's SDK returns data in a slightly different shape. Sometimes the sender ID is called `senderId` (camelCase) and sometimes it's `sender_id` (snake_case). So Peter made the code check for both: "Is it senderId? No? Then check sender_id."

It's like looking for someone who might be wearing either a red hat or a blue hat - you check for both just to be safe.

This change makes the code more future-proof because the official SDK is less likely to break when Twilio updates their API.

## The Changes

This commit switched from manual API requests to using the Twilio SDK:

- Replaced custom `request()` call with `client.messaging.v2.channelsSenders.list({ channel: 'whatsapp', pageSize: 50 })`
- Added a comment explaining the preference for the official SDK
- Updated sender matching logic to check for both `senderId` (SDK format) and `sender_id` (raw API format) to handle format variations
- Used `(client as any)` to bypass TypeScript's strict typing since Twilio's types are very broad

This makes the code more maintainable by using official Twilio SDK methods instead of raw HTTP requests.
