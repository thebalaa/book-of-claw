## The Translation

The AI assistant can do more than just chat—it can use command-line tools! This change documents some useful ones.

There's spotify-player for music, TTS (text-to-speech) tools for reading things aloud, and more. It's like showing someone their toolkit: "Here's a hammer, here's a screwdriver, here's what each one is for."

Now builders know what tools are available and can set them up for their AI assistant.

## The Changes

Adds a comprehensive section to the documentation listing useful CLI tools that Clawd can leverage, including music players (spotify-player), text-to-speech utilities, and other command-line utilities.
