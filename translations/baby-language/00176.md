## The Translation

Getting ready for a new release is like packing for a trip. Check the bags, update the labels, make sure everything is in order!

Version 0.1.1 is coming, and there's prep work to do:
- Bump the version number in package.json
- Make the branding lowercase (consistent styling)
- Update the user-agent string (so servers know who's calling)

Five files touched, 8 lines changed. Not a lot of code, but important housekeeping. Every release needs to be tidy and properly labeled!

## The Changes

Prepares for version 0.1.1 release with version bump, lowercase branding consistency, and user-agent string update. Updates documentation to match new style.
