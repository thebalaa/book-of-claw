## The Translation

When chunking text, WHERE you break matters. Breaking in the middle of a word or sentence looks bad!

This change makes the chunking smarter. It looks for natural break points:
- Paragraph endings
- Sentence endings
- Commas if needed

The result is chunks that read more naturally, like the AI planned to send multiple messages all along.

## The Changes

Improves chunking logic to find smarter break points at natural text boundaries like paragraphs and sentences rather than arbitrary character limits.
