## The Translation

When a reply gets chunked into multiple pieces, each piece needs to be sent separately. This change updates the web provider to handle that!

Instead of trying to send one big message, it can now send a list of smaller messages, one after another. The user gets them all in order.

## The Changes

Updates the web provider's auto-reply handling to properly send multi-payload replies as separate messages.
