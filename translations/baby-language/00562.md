title: "Asking Permission to Control Other Apps"

## The Translation

Clawdis can do cool things like control other apps or automate tasks. But macOS wants to make sure you're okay with that!

"Automation permission" is what lets one app control another. Like letting a robot helper press buttons in other apps for you.

This commit:
- Adds automation to the permissions list in settings
- Updates the IPC code to handle it
- Documents the new permission in the docs
- Includes the entitlement in the app bundle

Now Clawdis can properly ask for and use automation permissions to do its helper duties!

## The Changes

Adds automation permission (`com.apple.security.automation.apple-events`) support. Updates PermissionsSettings, IPC.swift, docs, and package script to include the new capability.
