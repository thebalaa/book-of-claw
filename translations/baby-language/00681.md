## The Translation

The onboarding window lists all the permissions the app needs. But the window was too small — some permissions were cut off!

One line makes the window bigger so the full permission list is visible. Users can see exactly what they're granting.

## The Changes

Enlarges onboarding window in `Onboarding.swift` (1 line) to fit the complete permission list.
