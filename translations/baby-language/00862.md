## The Translation

The voice wake overlay should appear in a consistent position. Now it snaps to the top-right of the screen!

17 lines implement the positioning logic. No more wandering overlay!

## The Changes

Positions overlay at top-right in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (20 lines changed, 17 added).
