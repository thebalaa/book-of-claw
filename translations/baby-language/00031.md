<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00031-d51cf21131-Add wa alias- drop deprecated setup alias-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added `wa` as a super-short alias for running the program. Now you can type just `wa up` instead of `warelay up` or `pnpm warelay up`. It saves typing!

He added it in two places:
- In package.json as a bin command (so `wa` works as a command-line tool)
- In package.json as an npm script (so `pnpm wa` works)

He also removed the `.alias("setup")` from the up command. This is a tiny breaking change - now only `up` works, not `setup`. But since the rename just happened, it's better to make the clean break now rather than carrying the old name forever.

It's like how everyone calls it "fridge" instead of "refrigerator" because it's faster to say.

## The Changes

This commit added a short alias and cleaned up old ones:

- Added `wa` to package.json bin section (alongside warelay and warely)
- Added `wa` npm script pointing to tsx src/index.ts
- Removed `.alias("setup")` from the up command - now only "up" works
- Fixed indentation issue in up command (closing brace placement)

Now users can use the minimal `wa` alias for quick commands.
