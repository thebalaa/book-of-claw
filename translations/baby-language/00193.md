## The Translation

Some tools are super careful. When you try to run a script, they ask "Are you SURE you want to run this?" Like a security guard checking IDs.

pnpm (our package manager) does this with build scripts. It wants to make sure you approve running code from packages you install. Good for security, but annoying when you know the scripts are fine!

We added config files that say "These build scripts are approved. Let them run without asking." Now the builds don't get stuck waiting for permission. The guard waves them through!

## The Changes

Adds .npmrc and pnpm-workspace.yaml configuration to approve build scripts. Allows automated builds to proceed without manual approval prompts.
