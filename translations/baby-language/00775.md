title: "Stronger Partial Transcript Tint"

## The Translation

The subdued tint for partial transcripts wasn't subdued enough! It was hard to tell partial from final text.

2 lines strengthen the tint — now the difference is more obvious.

## The Changes

Strengthens partial transcript tint in `VoicePushToTalk.swift` (1 line) and `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (1 line).
