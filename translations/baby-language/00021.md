<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00021-1af210988b-Support TWILIO_SENDER_SID override before sender lookup-/ -->

## The Translation

Remember how Peter added the TWILIO_SENDER_SID shortcut a few saves ago? Well, he forgot to actually make the program USE it! This commit fixes that.

Now the `findWhatsappSenderSid()` function (the helper that finds your WhatsApp sender) accepts an optional third parameter: the sender SID from your settings. If you provided it, the function says "Great! I'll use that" and returns it immediately - no search needed.

It's like having an express lane at the grocery store. If you already know exactly what you want, you skip the browsing and go straight to checkout.

The function logs in verbose mode: "Using TWILIO_SENDER_SID from env: [your SID]" so you know the shortcut is working.

And down in the setup command, Peter updated the call to actually pass in `env.whatsappSenderSid` as the third parameter. Before, the program was reading the setting but not using it - like carrying a permission slip but never handing it in.

## The Changes

This commit actually implemented the TWILIO_SENDER_SID override:

- Added `explicitSenderSid?` optional parameter to `findWhatsappSenderSid()`
- Added check at start of function: if `explicitSenderSid` is provided, log it in verbose mode and return it immediately
- Updated the call to `findWhatsappSenderSid()` in the setup command to pass `env.whatsappSenderSid` as the third argument
- Minor formatting cleanup (added line break in verbose error logging)
- Updated error message text slightly: "Set TWILIO_SENDER_SID" instead of "Provide TWILIO_SENDER_SID"

Now the TWILIO_SENDER_SID environment variable actually works as a skip-discovery mechanism.
