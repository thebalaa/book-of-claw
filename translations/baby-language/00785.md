title: "Keeping Empty Trigger Rows"

## The Translation

The trigger phrase list was removing empty rows. But what if you want to add more triggers later? Keep the rows!

2 lines change how empty trigger rows are handled — they're kept instead of deleted.

## The Changes

Updates `AppState.swift` (4 lines changed) to keep empty trigger rows in the list.
