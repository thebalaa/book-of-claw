<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00029-4a7cfbcc7c-Rename setup-up -alias kept- and keep process alive-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter renamed the `setup` command to `up` (short for "bring up the webhook"). It's quicker to type `warelay up` than `warelay setup`. He kept "setup" as an alias so old scripts still work.

He also added a new `poll` command - it's exactly like `monitor` but with a friendlier name and better description. Polling is for when you can't use webhooks (maybe your network blocks them, or you don't want to expose a public URL). The program just checks Twilio every few seconds for new messages.

When webhooks fail (either funnel or webhook update), the program now shows a helpful tip: "you can fall back to polling (no webhooks needed): `pnpm warelay poll --interval 5 --lookback 10`"

It's like giving people a backup plan - if the fancy instant-notification system doesn't work, here's the slower-but-reliable checking method.

## The Changes

This commit renamed the setup command and improved error guidance:

- Renamed `setup` command to `up` with `.alias("setup")` for backwards compatibility
- Changed description to "Bring up webhook + Tailscale Funnel..." instead of "Auto-setup..."
- Created new `poll` command (duplicate of `monitor`) with description "Poll Twilio for inbound WhatsApp messages (non-webhook mode)"
- Added polling fallback tip to funnel failure error message
- Added polling fallback tip to webhook update failure error message
- Fixed missing `await waitForever()` call in up command (was indented wrong)

Now users have clearer guidance when webhook setup fails.
