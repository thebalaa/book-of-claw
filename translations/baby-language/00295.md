title: "Show Typing After IPC"

## The Translation

After the IPC system sends a message, the user should see "typing..." to know something is happening.

This change makes sure the typing indicator shows up after IPC communication. It's a small polish—users always know the AI is working, even when IPC stuff is happening behind the scenes.

Good user experience is in the details!

## The Changes

Adds typing indicator display after IPC send operations, ensuring users see feedback during inter-process communication activities.
