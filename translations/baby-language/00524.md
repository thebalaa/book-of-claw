## The Translation

Have you ever seen a notebook where someone tried to cram EVERYTHING onto one page? Super messy and hard to read, right?

Computer files can get like that too. If a file grows bigger and bigger, it becomes hard to understand. You forget where things are. Other people can't figure out what's going on.

So the team added a new rule to their guidebook: every file should stay under 500 lines of code. If a file starts getting close to that limit, you need to split it up into smaller, organized pieces. Think of it like having separate notebooks for different subjects instead of one giant notebook for everything!

The rule says to "check frequently" — like keeping an eye on your notebook to make sure it's not getting overstuffed.

## The Changes

Adds a guardrail to `AGENTS.md`: keep every file ≤ 500 lines of code. Encourages refactoring and splitting files before they exceed this limit, and checking frequently during development.
