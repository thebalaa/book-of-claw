title: "Fixing a Crash When Asking for Permissions"

## The Translation

Imagine you're asking your parent for permission to go to a friend's house, but you ask in a weird way that confuses them. They might just... freeze up!

The permission system had a bug like this. When the app tried to ask macOS for certain permissions (like using the microphone), sometimes the code would get tangled up and crash. The problem was about "actors" — special Swift features that make sure only one thing happens at a time.

The fix makes sure the permission requests happen on the right "thread" (like making sure you ask your parent when they're listening, not when they're in the shower). The code now properly handles the actor isolation, so no more crashes!

## The Changes

Fixes a crash in `PermissionManager.swift` and `XPCService.swift` related to actor isolation when triggering permission prompts. Ensures permission dialog triggers happen on the correct actor/thread to avoid assertion failures.
