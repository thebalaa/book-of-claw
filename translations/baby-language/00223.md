## The Translation

When something breaks, it really helps to know what happened. Did the internet go out? Did WhatsApp kick us off? Did we try to reconnect?

This change adds "logging" to the reconnection code—basically, the computer now writes down what it's doing while trying to reconnect. "Attempting reconnect #1... failed. Waiting 5 seconds. Attempting #2..."

There's also a new troubleshooting guide! It's like a helpful FAQ that says "If you see this error, try this. If you see that error, check this." Now when things go wrong, you have a map to help find your way back.

## The Changes

Adds detailed logging throughout the reconnection flow so operators can trace connection issues. Creates a new troubleshooting document with common scenarios, error messages, and solutions for web relay connection problems.
