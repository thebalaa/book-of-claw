<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00102-35d7fe7fc7-chore- log web media sends-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added logging when images/media are sent via the web provider. Now you see confirmation when media is sent successfully, just like with text messages.

Helpful for debugging and monitoring media operations.

## The Changes

- Added media send logging for web provider
- Logs successful image/file sends
- Consistent with text message logging

Media sends are now logged for visibility.
