## The Translation

If you dictate a lot of text, the overlay can get really tall! Instead of taking over the whole screen, now it:
- Grows up to 400 pixels
- Then becomes scrollable

A nice balance between showing content and not overwhelming the screen.

## The Changes

Allows overlay to grow to 400px then scroll in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (4 lines changed).
