## The Translation

Have you ever written something, read it later, and thought "hmm, that word should be different"? Maybe you wrote "big" but "huge" sounds better?

Someone was reading the README (the project's welcome page) and noticed one tiny thing that could be improved. Just one line. Not a bug, not a new feature — just making a sentence read a little better.

It's like fixing a small typo or adjusting where a picture hangs on the wall. Barely noticeable, but someone cared enough to make it just right!

## The Changes

Minor README update — a single line change for clarity or style improvement.
