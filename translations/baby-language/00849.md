title: "Reconnect and Relax Parsing"

## The Translation

Two fixes in one:
1. Control channel reconnects when it hits EOF (connection closed)
2. RPC text parsing is more relaxed (handles edge cases better)

7 lines added, 2 removed. More resilient communication!

## The Changes

Adds EOF reconnection to `ControlChannel.swift` (7 lines) and relaxes RPC parsing in command-reply.
