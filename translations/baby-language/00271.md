## The Translation

Look at all these cool examples! This change adds documentation showing how the AI can:

- Post tweets automatically
- Recognize what song is playing (like Shazam!)

Imagine texting your AI "what song is this?" while holding your phone near a speaker, and it tells you! Or scheduling tweets to go out at certain times.

Examples like these inspire people to build amazing things.

## The Changes

Adds documentation examples demonstrating Twitter automation capabilities and music recognition integration using audio identification services.
