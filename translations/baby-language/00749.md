title: "Showing Errors Instead of Pending"

## The Translation

The health status was showing "pending" even when there was an error. That's confusing!

4 lines fix this — when there's an error, show the error message instead of "pending". Clear communication!

## The Changes

Updates `HealthStore.swift` (3 lines) and CLI (1 line) to surface health errors instead of showing pending.
