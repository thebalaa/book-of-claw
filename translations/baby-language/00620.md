title: "Removing the Blue Ring Around the Icon"

## The Translation

When you click on something in macOS, it sometimes gets a blue "focus ring" around it. On the About icon, this looked distracting.

One line removes that ring. The icon still works the same, just looks cleaner!

## The Changes

Adds 1 line to `AboutSettings.swift` to remove the focus ring from the app icon button.
