## The Translation

Imagine the relay watcher window is already open and running. Before, if you wanted to see it, you had to start a whole new one. That's like opening a second copy of the same game — confusing!

Now there's a special command: `relay:tmux:attach`. It's like a door that lets you walk INTO a window that's already running. You don't create a new one; you just join the one that exists.

This is really handy when the relay has been running all night and you wake up wanting to check on it. Just attach and see what it's been up to!

## The Changes

Adds a `relay:tmux:attach` CLI command to join an existing tmux relay session without creating a new one. Refactors the relay_tmux code to separate the attach logic.
