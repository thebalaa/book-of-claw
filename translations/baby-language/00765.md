## The Translation

Voice wake listens continuously, but what if you want a push-to-talk button? Press a key, speak, release!

This big feature adds:
- `VoicePushToTalk.swift` (249 lines!) — the main logic
- Hotkey registration
- Integration with voice wake
- Tests (24 lines)

297 new lines for a whole new way to input voice commands!

## The Changes

Adds push-to-talk hotkey with `VoicePushToTalk.swift` (249 lines), UI integration, and tests. 297 lines total across 7 files.
