title: "Using System Node for Relay"

## The Translation

The relay should use the system's Node.js installation. Force it!

23 lines added, 12 removed. The relay manager now finds and uses system node.

## The Changes

Forces relay to run via system node in `RelayProcessManager.swift` (25 lines) and `Utilities.swift` (10 lines).
