## The Translation

They say a picture is worth a thousand words. When you visit a project's page, a nice header image makes it feel professional and inviting — like the cover of a book!

We added a header image to the README. Not just any tiny image — this one is 1.4 MEGABYTES! (That's pretty big for a picture.) It probably has the project name in a cool font, maybe some nice colors or artwork.

Now when people visit our project page, the first thing they see is this beautiful banner. First impressions matter, and ours just got a lot better!

## The Changes

Adds a header image (README-header.png) to the repository and embeds it at the top of the README. Improves visual appeal and project branding.
