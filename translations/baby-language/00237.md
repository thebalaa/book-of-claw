title: "A Helper for Running Heartbeats"

## The Translation

Running heartbeats on a schedule can be tricky. You might want them to run in the background, maybe inside a terminal multiplexer like tmux (which is like having multiple screens inside one screen).

This change adds a "relay helper" that makes it easier to set up scheduled heartbeats. It's like a little assistant that handles all the complicated timing stuff so you don't have to.

The CLI tests also got fixed up to make sure the heartbeat commands work correctly. And the docs explain how to use this new helper.

## The Changes

Adds a relay helper function for scheduling heartbeats and fixes CLI tests for heartbeat commands. Updates documentation with examples of how to set up periodic heartbeats using the helper, including integration with tmux sessions.
