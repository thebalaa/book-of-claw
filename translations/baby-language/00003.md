## The Translation

Peter noticed something: he had asked for a helper (a dependency called `@types/json5`) that he didn't actually need anymore. It's like ordering training wheels for a bike when the bike already comes with training wheels built in.

The json5 library (a toolbox for reading a special kind of text file) already knows how to describe itself to TypeScript. So Peter removed the extra helper from the shopping list (the package.json file).

Less stuff to carry around means the toy box stays lighter and cleaner!

## The Changes

This commit removed the `@types/json5` package from the `devDependencies` section of `package.json`. The json5 library version 2.2.3 already includes its own TypeScript type definitions, making the separate `@types/json5` package unnecessary. This is a small cleanup that reduces the number of dependencies in the project.
