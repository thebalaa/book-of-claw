## The Translation

Ever wonder what the AI is doing behind the scenes? Now you can with "/verbose" mode!

When verbose is on, you can see when the AI uses tools—like searching the web or reading files. The tool results get shown to you too, not just the final answer.

It's like watching someone cook instead of just getting the finished meal. You can see all the ingredients going in!

## The Changes

Adds `/verbose` directive allowing users to see tool usage and results during AI processing. Tools and their outputs are shown before the final reply.
