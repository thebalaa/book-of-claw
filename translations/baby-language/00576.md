## The Translation

When you click "View Logs," it's helpful to know WHERE the logs are, not just have them open. Maybe you want to share the file, or open it with a different program.

This improvement:
1. Shows the full path to the log file in the UI
2. Opens the file's location in Finder (not just the file)

Now you can see something like `/tmp/clawdis/relay.log` and clicking opens Finder right to that folder. Much more informative!

## The Changes

Updates `DebugSettings.swift` (14 lines) to display the log file path and open its location in Finder rather than directly opening the file.
