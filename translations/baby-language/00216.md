## The Translation

Sometimes when you ask the computer to do something, it takes too long and the computer has to say "Sorry, time's up!" But the old message didn't give you enough clues about what went wrong.

Now the timeout message includes the "current working directory"—which is like telling someone "I was looking in the kitchen when I ran out of time." This helps the builder figure out what happened.

Small detail, but very helpful when things go wrong!

## The Changes

Enhances the command timeout error message to include the current working directory (cwd), making it easier to debug timeout issues by showing where the command was executed from.
