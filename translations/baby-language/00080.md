## The Translation

Peter made Claude JSON parsing more robust. Now it handles malformed JSON gracefully, logs parsing errors properly, and falls back to treating output as plain text when JSON parsing fails.

It's defensive programming - assuming things might go wrong and handling it gracefully.

## The Changes

- Added try-catch around JSON parsing
- Better error messages for invalid JSON
- Fallback to text mode on parse failure
- Improved logging of parsing errors

Claude JSON parsing now handles errors gracefully.
