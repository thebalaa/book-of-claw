## The Translation

TypeScript types help catch bugs before they happen. The webchat server's types were a bit loose.

57 lines added, 57 removed — same amount of code, but with stricter types and better formatting. Safer code!

## The Changes

Tightens types and formatting in `server.ts` (114 lines changed, net zero) for better type safety.
