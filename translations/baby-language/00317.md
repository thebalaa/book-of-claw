## The Translation

Spring cleaning! The Claude prompt gets a small tidy, and the npm lock file gets removed.

Wait, didn't we just add that lock file? Sometimes you add something and realize it's causing more problems than it solves. The lock file was making things complicated, so away it goes!

Knowing when to remove things is as important as knowing when to add them.

## The Changes

Tidies the Claude prompt configuration and removes the package-lock.json file that was causing complications.
