title: "Finding Clawdis for Health Checks"

## The Translation

The health check needs to run the `clawdis` command. But where is it? The path was hardcoded and might not work on all systems.

This one-line fix uses the proper resolver to find the command. Now health checks work regardless of where Clawdis is installed!

## The Changes

Updates `HealthStore.swift` (1 line) to use the command resolver for finding the clawdis executable path.
