## The Translation

Voice recognition needs to distinguish speech from background noise. This "noise floor tracking" helps:
- Monitors ambient noise level
- Adjusts thresholds dynamically
- Better speech detection

30 new lines make voice wake more accurate in noisy environments!

## The Changes

Adds speech noise floor tracking to `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (31 lines changed, 30 added).
