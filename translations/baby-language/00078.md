<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00078-7fa071267c-feat- add logger and twilio poll backoff-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a proper logging system to replace scattered console.log statements. Now all logging goes through a central logger that can control verbosity and formatting.

He also added exponential backoff for Twilio polling - if polling fails, it waits longer before trying again (1 second, then 2, then 4, etc.) instead of hammering the API repeatedly.

## The Changes

- Created centralized logger module
- Replaced console.log with logger calls
- Added exponential backoff for Twilio polling
- Better control over log verbosity

Logging is now unified and polling is more respectful of rate limits.
