<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00104-a1fab23439-ci- pin Node to 22-11-0 and print version-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter pinned the Node.js version in CI to 22.11.0 and added logging to show which version is running. This ensures tests run in a consistent environment.

Different Node versions can behave differently, so pinning ensures reproducible builds.

## The Changes

- Pinned Node to version 22.11.0 in GitHub Actions
- Added version logging to CI output
- Ensures consistent test environment

CI now runs on a specific, consistent Node version.
