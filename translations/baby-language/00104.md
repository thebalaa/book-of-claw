<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00104-a1fab234-ci: pin Node to 22.11.0 and print version-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made a small but important change to how the robot helper (the CI system) sets up its workspace.

Before, the instructions said "use Node version 22" — which is like saying "bring me a size 22 shoe." But shoe sizes can vary a bit! Sometimes you get 22.1, sometimes 22.5. Peter wanted to be more specific.

Now the instructions say "use Node version 22.11.0 exactly" — like asking for a specific shoe with the exact model number. No surprises.

He also added a step that prints out which version got installed, so you can double-check. It's like the robot saying "I'm wearing shoe 22.11.0!" before starting work.

Tiny change — just 4 lines — but it helps avoid "it worked on my computer but not here" problems.

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on November 25, 2025 to pin Node.js to version 22.11.0 (previously just "22"). He also added a `node -v` step to print the installed version during CI runs. This ensures consistent behavior across builds by eliminating version drift.
