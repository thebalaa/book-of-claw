title: "Showing Tool Arguments"

## The Translation

When the AI uses a tool, it doesn't just say "I used search." Now it shows WHAT it searched for! "search: 'weather in Paris'"

Including the arguments (the inputs to the tool) helps you understand exactly what the AI did. More context = better understanding.

## The Changes

Adds tool argument metadata to verbose output prefixes, showing what inputs were provided to each tool.
