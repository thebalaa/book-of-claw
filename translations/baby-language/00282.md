## The Translation

The AI doesn't automatically know what time it is. If you ask "good morning!" at 10 PM, it might not realize that's weird!

This change adds a "timestamp prefix" option. When enabled, every message includes the current date and time. Now the AI always knows when you're talking!

"[2026-02-16 22:30] Good morning!" → The AI can now say "Good evening! It's actually nighttime!"

## The Changes

Adds `timestampPrefix` configuration option that prepends the current date and time to messages, giving the AI awareness of when messages are sent.
