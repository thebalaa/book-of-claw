## The Translation

Every good book needs a catchy title. Every good movie needs a tagline. "In space, no one can hear you scream." Memorable, right?

The README is like the front cover of our project. People see it first. We added a tagline — a short, catchy phrase that tells you what this project is about in just a few words.

It's like putting a banner on your lemonade stand: "Best Lemonade in Town!" Except ours is about code. One line added, but it makes the whole page feel more welcoming and clear.

## The Changes

Adds a tagline to the README for better first-impression communication. A concise description to help visitors immediately understand the project.
