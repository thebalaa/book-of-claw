## The Translation

You know how some stores put their slogan on a banner at the VERY top? "Welcome to Joe's — Best Pizza Since 1985!" Right there when you walk in.

We had our tagline, but it wasn't quite in the perfect spot. It should be right up in the header where everyone sees it first thing!

We moved it up and tidied the formatting. Actually, we made things SHORTER (removed 2 lines, kept 1). Sometimes getting things right means moving stuff around until it clicks.

## The Changes

Repositions the tagline into the README header for better visibility. Consolidates and simplifies the top section of the documentation.
