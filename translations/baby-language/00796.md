## The Translation

The control channel is implemented! A new way for apps to communicate:
- `control-channel.ts` (189 lines!) — the main implementation
- `heartbeat-events.ts` (35 lines) — moved to infra
- Health and status commands updated

330 lines added, 135 removed. The relay has a proper control API now!

## The Changes

Adds control channel with `infra/control-channel.ts` (189 lines), refactors heartbeat-events, updates health and status commands.
