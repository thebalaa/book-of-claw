## The Translation

Imagine you have one HUGE toy box with everything jumbled together—action figures, building blocks, stuffed animals, art supplies, everything! Finding anything takes forever.

What if you got separate smaller boxes? One for action figures, one for blocks, one for art stuff? Much easier to find things!

That's what this change does. There was one giant file called `provider-web.ts` that did EVERYTHING related to web messaging. It was almost 1,000 lines long! Hard to read, hard to fix, hard to understand.

Now it's split into friendly smaller files: one handles logging in, one handles incoming messages, one handles outgoing messages, one deals with pictures and videos, and so on. Each file has one job and does it well.

The code still does everything it did before—we just organized it better.

## The Changes

Refactors the monolithic `provider-web.ts` into a modular structure under `src/web/`. Creates separate modules for: auto-reply handling, inbound message processing, login flow, media handling, outbound message sending, and session management. The main provider file now just coordinates these smaller, focused modules.
