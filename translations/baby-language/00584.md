title: "Being Smarter About Finding the Remote CLI"

## The Translation

When forwarding voice commands to a remote computer, we need to find where `clawdis-mac` is installed there. Different systems put things in different places!

This "hardening" makes the lookup more robust:
- Checks multiple common paths
- Handles PATH environment variables properly
- Caches results so we don't keep searching
- Better error messages when not found

The system is now much more resilient to different remote machine configurations.

## The Changes

Enhances remote CLI lookup in `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (71 new lines). Updates settings and tests for the improved lookup behavior.
