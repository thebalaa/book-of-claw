## The Translation

New behavior needs tests! This adds tests that make sure:
- Group messages include who sent them (the sender)
- Group messages bypass allowFrom correctly

Tests catch bugs before users see them!

## The Changes

Adds tests verifying group messages properly carry sender information and bypass allowFrom restrictions.
