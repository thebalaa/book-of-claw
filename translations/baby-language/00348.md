title: "Knowing When the AI Is Done"

## The Translation

The tau rpc system needed to know when the AI agent finishes. There's a special signal called "agent_end" that means "I'm all done!"

This change makes tau rpc listen for that signal and properly resolve (finish) when it sees it. Now we know exactly when the AI is finished thinking.

## The Changes

Updates tau rpc to resolve (complete) when it receives the agent_end signal, properly detecting when AI processing is finished.
