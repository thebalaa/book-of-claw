## The Translation

The runtime restart needs to happen inside the actor (Swift's concurrency model). Also log unexpected RPC payloads.

9 lines added, 6 removed. More correct concurrency and better debugging!

## The Changes

Delays restart inside actor in runtime (13 lines) and logs unexpected RPC payloads in AgentRPC.
