title: "Making Remote Setup More Compact"

## The Translation

The remote setup card in onboarding was taking up too much space. Advanced SSH fields (that most people don't need) were cluttering the view.

This refactoring:
- Makes the card more compact
- Moves advanced SSH fields to a less prominent spot
- 22 lines added, 15 removed

Cleaner first-run experience!

## The Changes

Compacts remote setup card in `Onboarding.swift` (37 lines changed) and relocates advanced SSH fields.
