title: "Voice Wake Forwarding Matches Remote Mode"

## The Translation

If you're in remote mode, the voice wake forwarding should match those settings. Before, they could get out of sync!

27 lines added, 11 removed. The voice forwarding section now aligns with your remote mode settings automatically.

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeForwardSection.swift` (15 lines) and `VoiceWakeSettings.swift` (23 lines) to align forwarding with remote mode.
