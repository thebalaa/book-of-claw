## The Translation

Sometimes WhatsApp sessions get "stuck"—they stop responding but don't actually disconnect. It's like a phone call where neither person is talking but the line is still open.

This change adds "auto-recovery." The system notices when things seem stuck and automatically tries to fix it—maybe reconnecting or restarting the session.

It's like having a watchdog that barks when something's wrong and then goes to get help!

## The Changes

Implements auto-recovery mechanism for stuck WhatsApp sessions. Detects when sessions become unresponsive and automatically attempts recovery actions to restore connectivity.
