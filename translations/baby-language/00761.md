title: "Keeping the Webchat Tunnel Alive"

## The Translation

The remote webchat tunnel would sometimes die and not reconnect. Not great if you're using it!

72 new lines make the tunnel more robust:
- Detect disconnections
- Automatically reconnect
- Keep the tunnel alive

Much more reliable remote webchat!

## The Changes

Hardens remote webchat tunnel in `WebChatWindow.swift` (83 lines changed) with keep-alive logic and auto-reconnect.
