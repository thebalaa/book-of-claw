<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00062-e12e6989c0-Switch to Baileys multi-file auth with latest rc-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter switched how WhatsApp Web authentication is saved. Instead of one big file, it now saves auth data across multiple small files. This is how the latest Baileys version works.

It's like switching from one big notebook to a filing cabinet with many folders - more organized and efficient.

## The Changes

This commit switched to multi-file auth:

- Implemented Baileys multi-file auth state system
- Created auth directory structure instead of single file
- Updated to latest Baileys RC with multi-file support
- Modified login/logout to work with new auth format

Authentication is now stored more efficiently across multiple files.
