## The Translation

What if someone sends you a voice message? Claude can't "listen" to audio the way it can read text. It's like giving a book to someone who only understands spoken words!

The solution: TRANSCRIPTION! We turn the audio into text first. "Hey, what's the weather?" becomes "Hey, what's the weather?" written out. Then Claude can read it!

This is a big feature — 215 new lines! You can now send voice messages, and they'll be transcribed before Claude sees them. The CLI has a new option to enable this. Audio is no longer a barrier!

## The Changes

Adds optional audio transcription feature via CLI. Voice messages can be converted to text before processing by Claude. Includes configuration options, documentation, and test coverage.
