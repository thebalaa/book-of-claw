<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00073-39b3fffe3b-refactor- extract twilio message utilities-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter extracted Twilio message-specific utilities into their own module. Functions for sending messages, checking status, and handling message operations now live together in one place.

It's continuing the modularization effort - every piece of functionality gets its own home.

## The Changes

This commit extracted Twilio message utils:

- Created Twilio message module
- Moved send and status check functions
- Grouped message-related operations
- Improved module cohesion

Message handling is now centralized and easier to maintain.
