title: "Starting the RPC Worker Right Away"

## The Translation

The RPC worker is the phone line for agent messages. But when should we pick up the phone?

This change starts the RPC worker immediately when the app launches:
- Worker starts in MenuBar's init
- If it fails to start, agent sends fail immediately (rather than hanging)
- No more lazy initialization surprises

Better to fail fast and clearly than to have mysterious delayed failures!

## The Changes

Updates `AgentRPC.swift` (8 lines changed) and `MenuBar.swift` (1 line) to start the RPC worker at app launch and fail explicitly if not running.
