## The Translation

Trigger phrases were being sanitized (cleaned up) immediately as you typed. But that interferes with editing!

3 lines change when sanitization happens — only when triggers are actually applied, not during editing.

## The Changes

Moves trigger sanitization to apply-time in `AppState.swift` (9 lines) and `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (2 lines).
