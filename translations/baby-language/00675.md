title: "When Was Health Last Checked?"

## The Translation

The health status in the menu showed "healthy" or "unhealthy" but not WHEN it was checked. If the check is from 5 minutes ago, is it still accurate?

Now the menu shows the age: "Healthy (2m ago)". You know how fresh the information is!

19 lines added, 7 removed.

## The Changes

Updates `MenuBar.swift` (26 lines changed) to show health result age in the menu (e.g., "Healthy (2m ago)").
