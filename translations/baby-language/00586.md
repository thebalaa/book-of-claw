title: "Making the Critter's Ears Wiggle When Listening"

## The Translation

When a puppy hears something, its ears perk up! The Clawdis critter should do the same.

This adds a live voice wake listener and ear animations:
- When voice wake is enabled, the critter actively listens
- When it hears something, the ears wiggle!
- The whole runtime for voice detection is now properly wired up

145 lines of new code in `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` handles all the listening and event firing. Plus 28 lines in AppState to connect everything. Your critter is now truly listening!

## The Changes

Adds `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (145 lines) for live voice wake listening. Updates `AppState.swift` (28 lines) to manage runtime state and trigger ear animations when the listener detects audio.
