## The Translation

When you build lots of new things quickly, sometimes you leave a few screws loose. This change goes back and tightens up all those loose screws in the test files!

The builder had made some changes to the CLI and web modules, and the tests needed a few tweaks to match. Nothing broken, just some improvements to make the tests cleaner and more thorough.

It's like proofreading your essay before turning it in—catching little things you missed the first time around.

## The Changes

Commits accumulated test improvements across CLI and web modules. Includes better test organization, clearer assertions, and improved mock setups for login, logout, inbox monitoring, outbound messaging, and session handling tests.
