## The Translation

Pi (the AI agent) can now resume previous conversations using "--continue"!

Instead of starting fresh every time, you can pick up where you left off. It's like bookmarking your place in a book so you can continue reading later.

## The Changes

Adds support for resuming Tau sessions with the --continue flag, allowing Pi agent conversations to continue from previous context.
