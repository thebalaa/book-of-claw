title: "Making the IPC Door More Secure"

## The Translation

The IPC socket is like a secret door that different parts of the program use to talk to each other. But we need to make sure only the right programs can use that door!

This change "hardens" the socket—adds extra locks and checks. Now it's much harder for unauthorized programs to sneak in and cause trouble.

Security is like locking your doors at night. Better safe than sorry!

## The Changes

Hardens the IPC socket security with improved access controls and validation. Adds tests to verify the security measures work correctly.
