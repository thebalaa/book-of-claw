## The Translation

Oops! The example config had a real phone number in it. That's not good—you don't want random people calling that number!

This change "redacts" (hides) the phone number by replacing it with something fake like "+1234567890" or "your-number-here."

It's like when you show someone how to fill out a form, but you use "John Doe" instead of your real name. Privacy matters!

## The Changes

Redacts real phone numbers from the example configuration in the documentation, replacing them with placeholder values.
