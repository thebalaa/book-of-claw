title: "The Critter Gets Ear Holes!"

## The Translation

When voice wake is active, the critter should look like it's listening. How do you show that? Ear holes!

The critter icon now has little holes in its ears when voice wake is on. It's like showing that sound can get into the ears — visually indicating "I'm listening!"

55 lines of new icon drawing code add this cute detail.

## The Changes

Updates `MenuBar.swift` (55 lines) to add ear holes to the critter icon when voice wake is active. Updates `docs/mac/icon.md` documentation.
