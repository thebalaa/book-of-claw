<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00087-28277a298a-feat- retries for webhook bring-up and send -json docs-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added retry logic to webhook bring-up operations. Sometimes starting the webhook or configuring Twilio fails temporarily - now it retries automatically instead of failing immediately.

He also documented the new --json send feature.

## The Changes

- Added retries to webhook start
- Added retries to Twilio webhook configuration
- Documented --json flag in README
- More resilient webhook operations

Webhook setup is now more reliable with automatic retries.
