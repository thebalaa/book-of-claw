title: "Making Heartbeat Settings Look Better"

## The Translation

The heartbeat settings (interval, timeout) were taking up too much vertical space. Each setting was on its own line.

This refactoring puts them inline — side by side instead of stacked. Same information, less scrolling needed. Like organizing your toys in a row instead of a tower!

## The Changes

Refactors heartbeat input layout in `ConfigSettings.swift` (20 lines changed) to display settings inline rather than stacked.
