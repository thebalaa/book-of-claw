title: "RPC Only — No More Old Way"

## The Translation

When you improve how something works, sometimes you need to remove the old way completely. Having both creates confusion and bugs!

This commit removes the CLI fallback for agent sends. Now it's RPC only:
- ✓ Uses the fast persistent worker
- ✗ No more spawning CLI for each message (removed!)

13 lines deleted, 3 added. The code is simpler and there's only one path for messages to follow. Clean!

## The Changes

Removes CLI fallback from `XPCService.swift`, making RPC the only path for agent sends. Net reduction of 10 lines while simplifying the code.
