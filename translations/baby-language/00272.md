## The Translation

Oops! When we renamed the file from "claude-config.md" to "clawd.md", the README still had a link to the old name. Clicking it would lead nowhere—a broken link!

This tiny fix updates the link to point to the new filename. Now when people click, they actually get to the documentation!

It's like updating a street sign after a road gets renamed.

## The Changes

Fixes a broken documentation link in the README, updating the reference from claude-config.md to clawd.md.
