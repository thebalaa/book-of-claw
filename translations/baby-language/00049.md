<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00049-574a96050b-Add utility tests for paths- prefixes- and sleep-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter wrote tests for the utility functions: path normalization, WhatsApp prefix handling, and the sleep function. These are small helper functions but they're used everywhere, so it's important they work correctly.

The tests check things like:
- Does `normalizePath("webhook")` add the leading slash?
- Does `withWhatsAppPrefix("+1234")` add "whatsapp:" correctly?
- Does `sleep(100)` actually wait 100 milliseconds?

It's like testing each individual tool in your toolbox to make sure it works before building something complex.

## The Changes

This commit added utility function tests:

- Wrote tests for normalizePath()
- Wrote tests for withWhatsAppPrefix()
- Wrote tests for sleep() function
- Achieved high coverage on utility functions

Core helper functions now have test coverage ensuring reliability.
