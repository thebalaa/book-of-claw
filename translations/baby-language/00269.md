## The Translation

The documentation file was called "claude-config.md" but everyone was calling the project "Clawd." Time to update the filename!

The file gets renamed to "clawd.md" to match what people actually call it. The credits section also gets a small update.

Names should be consistent—it makes everything easier to find!

## The Changes

Renames the documentation file from `claude-config.md` to `clawd.md` for consistency with the Clawd project name. Updates credits information.
