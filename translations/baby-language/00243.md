title: "Letting Heartbeats Use a Specific Session"

## The Translation

When a heartbeat runs, it usually figures out which conversation to use automatically. But sometimes you want to be specific: "Use THIS conversation, not whatever you think is best."

Now you can! There's a session-id override that says "I don't care about your fancy logic—just use this exact session."

The fallback (backup plan) also got safer. If the override doesn't work, it won't crash—it'll gracefully try the next option.

## The Changes

Adds session-id override capability for heartbeat triggers, allowing explicit control over which session context is used. Also improves fallback safety when session resolution fails. Documents the new option in the changelog, README, and heartbeat docs.
