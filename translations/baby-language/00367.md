## The Translation

Big feature: group chat support! You can now @mention the AI in a group chat and it will respond.

It's like having the AI as a member of your friend group. "Hey @Clawd, what's the weather?" and it answers in the group!

A whole new documentation page explains how this works.

## The Changes

Adds group chat mention support, allowing the AI to be @mentioned in group conversations and respond appropriately. Includes comprehensive documentation.
