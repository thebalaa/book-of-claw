## The Translation

The previous commit started the cleanup, but there were more real-looking phone numbers hiding in the code and docs. This finishes the job!

All examples now use obviously fake numbers like `+15550001234` (555 numbers are reserved for fiction). No more worries about accidentally publishing someone's actual number.

## The Changes

Replaces phone numbers across 6 files (docs, CLI, tests) with clearly fake 555-prefix numbers. 22 lines changed.
