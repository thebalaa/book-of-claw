## The Translation

When the AI uses tools, we need to wait for ALL the work to finish. The "agent_end" signal tells us everything is done.

This change makes tau RPC wait patiently when tools are running. No more finishing early and missing results!

## The Changes

Updates tau RPC to properly wait for agent_end signal when tools are running, ensuring all tool operations complete before resolving.
