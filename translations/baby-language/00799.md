## The Translation

The close button was inside the bubble, which looked cramped. Float it outside!

22 lines added, 13 removed:
- Close button floats outside the bubble
- Less hover flicker when moving between button and content
- Cleaner visual design

## The Changes

Floats close button outside bubble and reduces hover flicker in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (35 lines changed).
