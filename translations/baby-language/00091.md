<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00091-6dd0d04206-chore- remove refactor plan doc-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter removed an old refactoring plan document since the refactoring is now complete. It's like throwing away a to-do list after you've finished all the tasks - no need to keep it around anymore.

## The Changes

- Removed obsolete refactor plan document
- Cleanup of outdated docs

Old planning docs removed since work is complete.
