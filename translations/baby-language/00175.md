## The Translation

When you get an update for your favorite game, don't you want to know what's new? "Added new character! Fixed that annoying bug! Improved loading times!"

That's what a CHANGELOG is — a diary of what changed in each version. Version 0.1.0 just came out, and now we're preparing 0.1.1!

We added 7 lines explaining what's new: colorized help, example footers, whatever else got improved. Now when people update, they can read the changelog and know exactly what they're getting!

## The Changes

Documents the 0.1.1 release changes in the CHANGELOG. Lists new features and improvements included in this version bump.
