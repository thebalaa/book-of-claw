## The Translation

When you don't know how to use something, what do you do? You ask for help! The same goes for computer programs.

The ClawdisCLI (the command-line version of Clawdis) didn't have a `--help` command. So if you typed `clawdis --help`, nothing useful happened. That's not friendly!

Now when you type `--help` or `-h`, the program tells you:
- What commands are available
- How to use each one
- What the program does

It's like having a helpful instruction card that comes with a new toy. Much better than guessing!

## The Changes

Adds `--help` and `-h` flags to ClawdisCLI. Prints usage information showing available commands and their descriptions. 24 new lines for help text and argument parsing.
