title: "Making pnpm Output Safe for JSON Parsing"

## The Translation

pnpm sometimes outputs extra stuff (warnings, progress bars) that isn't valid JSON. When the health check tries to parse this, it breaks!

This fix ensures only clean JSON gets to the parser:
- Filters out non-JSON lines
- Handles pnpm's extra output gracefully
- Includes tests to verify the fix

21 lines make health checks work even with chatty pnpm!

## The Changes

Updates `HealthStore.swift` (7 lines), `Utilities.swift` (3 lines), and tests (15 lines) to ensure pnpm output is JSON-safe.
