## The Translation

Names matter! The heartbeat helper for tmux had a confusing name, so the builder gave it a clearer one.

Also, heartbeats now write their logs to a specific file path instead of mixing with other logs. It's like giving heartbeats their own diary instead of writing in the family calendar.

There's even a new tmux documentation page explaining how to use the terminal multiplexer with this system. Tmux is super useful for running things in the background!

## The Changes

Renames the heartbeat tmux helper for clarity and adds a dedicated log file path for heartbeat activity. Creates new tmux documentation explaining how to use tmux sessions with the relay system. Includes additional CLI tests for the renamed command.
