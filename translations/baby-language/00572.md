title: "Finding Clawdis on the Remote Computer"

## The Translation

On different computers, programs might be installed in different places. The path might be `/usr/local/bin/clawdis-mac` or somewhere else.

This fix makes sure we look in the right place for the remote Clawdis installation:
- Adds a constant for the expected path
- Improves how we search for the program
- Adds tests to make sure the path checking works

Now the SSH check correctly finds Clawdis wherever it's installed on the remote machine!

## The Changes

Adds remote path constant and improves path resolution in `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift`. Updates `Constants.swift`, `Utilities.swift`, and adds tests (17 lines total).
