title: "Writing Down How the Dots Work"

## The Translation

When you make something cool, you should write down how it works so others can use it too!

This change is like writing a page in the instruction manual that says: "Here's how to control those typing dots." It tells people they can choose how often the dots refresh—maybe every 5 seconds, maybe every 10, whatever works best for them.

And just like before, the builder also added more tests. More wiggle-checks to make sure the typing dots work in all sorts of situations. What if someone sends a really long message? What if the computer takes forever to think? The tests check all these cases.

Good builders don't just make things—they explain them and prove they work.

## The Changes

Adds documentation for the `typingIntervalSeconds` configuration option and expands test coverage for the typing indicator refresh feature. Tests now cover edge cases including different interval values and verify the behavior during extended command execution times.
