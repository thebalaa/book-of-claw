title: "Finding Logs in the Old Place Too"

## The Translation

Log files used to be stored in one location, then the location changed. But some people might still have old logs in the old place!

This update makes the log button smarter — it first looks for logs in the new location, and if not found, it falls back to the legacy (old) path. Like checking both your new backpack and your old one for your homework.

Now you can find your logs regardless of where they ended up!

## The Changes

Adds fallback logic to `DebugSettings.swift` (10 lines) to check the legacy log path if the current pino log file isn't found.
