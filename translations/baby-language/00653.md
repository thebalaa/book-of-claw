## The Translation

Code formatting is like handwriting — everyone has their own style, but it's easier to read when it's consistent. This commit runs the formatter on all the macOS Swift files.

147 lines added, 123 removed — but the code does the same thing. It just looks neater and follows the team's style guide now!

## The Changes

Formats 14 Swift files with consistent code style (270 lines changed). No functional changes, just cleaner formatting.
