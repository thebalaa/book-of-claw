title: "SSH Remote Uses Only Clawdis"

## The Translation

The SSH remote commands were trying to use different binaries. Simplify: just use `clawdis` for everything!

5 lines make the remote code more consistent.

## The Changes

Updates `Utilities.swift` (8 lines changed) to use clawdis exclusively for SSH remote commands.
