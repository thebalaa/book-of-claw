<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00098-df79c59c8e-docs- add guidance to use dedicated WhatsApp account-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a strong recommendation to the docs: use a dedicated WhatsApp account for the bot, not your personal account.

This is important for safety - you don't want the bot accidentally responding to your personal messages, and you don't want to risk your main account getting banned if something goes wrong.

It's like using a separate email for newsletter signups - keeps things organized and safe.

## The Changes

- Added recommendation for dedicated account
- Explained risks of using personal account
- Added security best practices
- Clear guidance in README

Users now have clear guidance to use a dedicated account for safety.
