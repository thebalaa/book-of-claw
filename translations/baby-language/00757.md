## The Translation

Sometimes you want the AI to think deeply for just ONE response, then go back to normal. The new `thinkingOnce` flag does exactly that!

One line addition to the agent command enables this option.

## The Changes

Adds `thinkingOnce` flag to `agent.ts` (1 line) for one-shot deep thinking.
