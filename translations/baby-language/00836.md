title: "Forwarding Tool Events to the Bus"

## The Translation

Tool and assistant events need to reach the "agent bus" (the event system). This forwards them!

25 new lines connect tool events to the bus so everything stays in sync.

## The Changes

Forwards tool/assistant events to agent bus in `command-reply.ts` (25 lines added).
