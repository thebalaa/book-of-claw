## The Translation

Remember how we split that giant file into smaller files? Well, each of those smaller files needs its own tests too!

Before, there was one big test file that tried to check everything at once. It was confusing—like having one teacher grade every subject for every student in the whole school.

Now each little module gets its own test buddy. The login code has login tests. The media code has media tests. The session code has session tests. Each test focuses on just one thing.

We also added some helper tools (called `test-helpers.ts`) that all the tests can share—like a supply closet that every classroom can use.

When you organize your code better, you can organize your tests better too!

## The Changes

Splits the large provider-web test suite into focused test files matching the new modular structure. Creates dedicated test files for: login, inbox monitoring, outbound messaging, and session handling. Extracts shared test utilities into a `test-helpers.ts` module to reduce duplication across test files.
