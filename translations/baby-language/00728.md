## The Translation

The Mac web chat was using complex RPC. Simpler approach: just use HTTP directly to talk to the relay!

Big refactoring:
- Bootstrap script updated (51 lines)
- Bundle rebuilt (3,545 lines changed)
- WebChatWindow simplified (174 lines changed)

1,832 lines added, 1,947 removed — net simpler!

## The Changes

Refactors macOS webchat to use relay HTTP transport directly. Updates bootstrap, bundle, and WebChatWindow.
