## The Translation

Here's a tricky problem: Signal (a messaging app) can get confused if two copies of the app try to connect at the same time. It's like two people trying to pick up the same phone call—chaos!

This change adds "IPC" (Inter-Process Communication)—a way for different parts of the system to talk to each other and coordinate. Now they say "I'm using Signal right now" and others wait their turn.

No more session corruption from stepping on each other's toes!

## The Changes

Implements IPC (Inter-Process Communication) to coordinate access to Signal sessions, preventing corruption that can occur when multiple processes attempt concurrent connections. Creates a new IPC module for managing session locks.
