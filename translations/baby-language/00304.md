## The Translation

🚨 Security fix! There was a "path traversal" vulnerability in the media server. This is a sneaky trick where a bad guy could request files like "../../etc/passwd" to access files they shouldn't!

This fix checks file paths carefully and blocks any attempts to escape the allowed folder. No more sneaky "../.." tricks!

Security vulnerabilities need to be fixed FAST. This one got patched quickly.

## The Changes

Fixes a path traversal vulnerability in the media server by validating and sanitizing file paths to prevent access to files outside the intended media directory.
