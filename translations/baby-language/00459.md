## The Translation

Big feature: a Sessions tab in the Mac app settings! You can now see and manage your conversation sessions right from the app.

This adds a lot of code (825 lines!) but makes the app much more useful.

## The Changes

Adds Sessions tab to Mac app settings for viewing and managing conversation sessions.
