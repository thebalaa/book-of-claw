## The Translation

The overlay's shadow was getting clipped (cut off) at the edges. It needs more room!

Adding an inset margin gives the shadow space to render fully. 6 lines for proper shadow display.

## The Changes

Adds inset margin to prevent overlay shadow clipping in `ControlChannel.swift` (2 lines) and overlay (7 lines).
