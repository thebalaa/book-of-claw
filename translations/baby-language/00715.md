title: "Loading Remote History Better"

## The Translation

The web chat in remote mode needed to load history from the remote server. The first attempt had issues, so this improves it:
- Uses a tau fallback (backup method)
- Sends messages to the right session

34 lines added, 12 removed — more reliable remote chat!

## The Changes

Updates `WebChatWindow.swift` (46 lines changed) to load remote history from tau fallback and send to correct session.
