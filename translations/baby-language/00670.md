## The Translation

Using Python to base64-encode text was a workaround. But why add Python as a dependency when `/bin/sh` can do the escaping directly?

This removes the Python step and uses shell escaping instead. 11 lines added, 16 removed — simpler and fewer dependencies!

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (27 lines changed) to use escaped literals under /bin/sh instead of Python encoding.
