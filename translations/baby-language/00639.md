## The Translation

When voice sending fails, knowing WHY is crucial. "Error" doesn't help. "SSH connection refused to host.example.com:22" does!

12 new lines, 6 removed. The Debug panel now shows much more detailed error information for voice send failures.

## The Changes

Updates `DebugSettings.swift` (18 lines changed) to surface detailed error messages when voice send operations fail.
