## The Translation

We had a same-phone prefix and a timestamp prefix... but what if you want to add other stuff too? Time for a more general system!

Now there are two main settings:
- `messagePrefix` — stuff added to incoming messages (like timestamps)
- `responsePrefix` — stuff added to outgoing replies (like "🤖: ")

It's like having labeled boxes instead of just throwing things in random drawers.

## The Changes

Generalizes the prefix configuration system into `messagePrefix` and `responsePrefix` options, allowing more flexible customization of both incoming message handling and outgoing response formatting.
