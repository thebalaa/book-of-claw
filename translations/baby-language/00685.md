title: "Disable Autostart Without Stopping the App"

## The Translation

The launch agent can autostart the app at login. But when you disabled it, it would sometimes kill the running app too! Not what you want.

This fix lets you disable autostart without affecting the currently running app. The launch agent gets smarter about what "disable" means.

Plus lots of test improvements and bundle rebuilds (1821 lines added, 1761 removed).

## The Changes

Fixes launch agent to disable autostart without killing running app. Updates across 10 files including Utilities, CLI, config, and tests.
