## The Translation

Remember our shiny badges (CI status, npm version, license)? They were in one spot, but now we have that beautiful header image. Where should the badges go?

We moved them BELOW the header image! It's like putting your Scout badges on your sash, not on your hat. The header image is the main attraction, and the badges support it from below.

We also restyled them a bit — spaced them out nicer, made them look good under the big banner. Design is all about these little details that make things feel polished!

## The Changes

Repositions the README badges below the header image and restyled their layout. Improves visual hierarchy with the new header image in place.
