## The Translation

When you finish a big craft project, you might sign your name and write the date on it. Software does something similar—it gets a version number!

The version number is like a birthday for the software. "Version 1.1.0" means this is the first big update after version 1.0. The middle number going from 0 to 1 means "we added cool new features!" (If we just fixed mistakes, only the last number would change.)

This tiny change just updates that version number in the project's name tag. It's like putting a new sticker on a lunchbox that says "Now with extra features!"

All those typing indicators and memory features? Now they're officially part of version 1.1.0.

## The Changes

Bumps the package version from 1.0.x to 1.1.0, marking a minor release that includes the new session system prompt optimization and typing indicator refresh features.
