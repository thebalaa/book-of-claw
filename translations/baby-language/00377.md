title: "Seeing Tool Arguments Early"

## The Translation

When a tool starts running, we already know what arguments it was called with. Why wait until it finishes to show them?

Now tool arguments are surfaced from "rpc start events"—the moment the tool begins. Users see what's happening even before results come in.

Faster feedback!

## The Changes

Surfaces tool arguments from RPC start events, showing what inputs tools received immediately when they begin running.
