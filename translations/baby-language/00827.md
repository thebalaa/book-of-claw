## The Translation

The push-to-talk hotkey was using the wrong Option key! Users expected the right Option key, not the left.

15 lines fix this, plus doc updates. Now PTT uses the right Option key as expected.

## The Changes

Switches push-to-talk to right Option key across VoicePushToTalk, settings, README, and docs (4 files).
