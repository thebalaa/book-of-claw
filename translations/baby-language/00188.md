## The Translation

When writing a release announcement, you have a title and a body. The title might say "Version 1.0 - The Big Update!" If the body ALSO starts with "Version 1.0 - The Big Update!" that's redundant!

We added a note to the release instructions: "The body should not repeat the title." It's basic writing advice, but sometimes you need to write it down so nobody forgets.

Good documentation includes these little reminders. They prevent mistakes and help everyone stay consistent. One line of clarification can save many awkward duplicate-titled releases!

## The Changes

Updates RELEASING.md to clarify that release body content should not repeat the release title. Improves release documentation quality.
