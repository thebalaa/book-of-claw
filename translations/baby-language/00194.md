## The Translation

We added image compression, but did we tell anyone how to control it? Documentation is just as important as the feature itself!

The README needed a note about media resize configuration. How big can images be? What's the maximum size? Can you turn resizing off?

One line added to the README answering these questions. Now users know the settings exist and where to find more info. Features without documentation might as well not exist — if people can't find them, they can't use them!

## The Changes

Documents the media resize configuration option in README. Helps users understand and configure the new image compression feature.
