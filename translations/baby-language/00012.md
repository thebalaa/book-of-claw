<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00012-7b7c148f48-Verbose mode now prints stdout-stderr of invoked commands-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made verbose mode even chattier. Now it doesn't just show you what commands the program is running - it also shows you what those commands say back.

Think of it like this: Before, you could see Peter asking someone a question, but you couldn't hear their answer. Now you hear both sides of the conversation.

When a command runs, it can say things two ways:
- Normal messages (stdout) - like regular talking
- Error messages (stderr) - like when something goes wrong

Now when verbose mode is on, the program prints both kinds of messages to the screen. If the command says something normal, you see it. If the command complains about something, you see that too.

It's like turning on captions for everything the program does.

## The Changes

This commit enhanced verbose logging in the `runExec()` function:

- After executing a command, if verbose mode is enabled, the function now prints the command's stdout (if not empty)
- It also prints the command's stderr to console.error (if not empty)
- Both outputs are trimmed to remove extra whitespace

This gives users complete visibility into what external commands are doing when verbose mode is on, including both successful output and any warnings or errors the commands produce.
