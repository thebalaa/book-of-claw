## The Translation

Imagine you have a pet hamster, and you want to watch it running on its wheel while you do other things. You'd put the cage where you can see it, right?

We built a special window called "tmux" (it's like having extra TV screens on your computer). Now you can tell the relay watcher to run inside this special window.

The relay watcher is like a guard dog — it watches for messages and tells you when something happens. Now it has its own cozy spot where you can peek at it anytime without it getting in the way of your other work.

## The Changes

Adds a `relay:tmux` CLI command that starts the relay watcher inside a tmux session. Creates a new relay_tmux.ts file with the logic to spawn and manage the tmux session.
