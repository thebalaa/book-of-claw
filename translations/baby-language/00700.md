title: "Health Info Moves to Debug"

## The Translation

The detailed health and CLI info was cluttering General settings. Most users don't need that detail!

This moves the technical info to Debug (where power users look) and keeps just a simple health row in General. 24 lines added, 11 removed — better organization!

## The Changes

Moves health/CLI details to `DebugSettings.swift` (13 lines) and simplifies health display in `GeneralSettings.swift` (22 lines changed).
