title: "Better Overlay Resizing and Tinting"

## The Translation

Two small overlay fixes:
1. Resize smoothly when text updates (not just on initial display)
2. Keep the final tint color (don't flash back to partial)

6 lines make the overlay feel more polished and consistent.

## The Changes

Fixes overlay resize on text updates and preserves final tint in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (8 lines changed).
