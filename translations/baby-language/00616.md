## The Translation

The launch agent (the background helper) was having two problems:
1. It wasn't staying alive when it should
2. It couldn't find programs because PATH wasn't set

These 7 lines fix both: the agent stays running and has the right environment to find commands.

## The Changes

Updates `Utilities.swift` (7 lines) to keep the launch agent alive and inject PATH environment variable.
