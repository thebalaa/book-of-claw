## The Translation

The Debug settings panel was getting long! With all the new features (log paths, relay controls, health info), it didn't fit on screen anymore.

This refactoring makes the Debug tab scrollable. The content reorganized (106 added, 103 removed) to work well in a scroll view. Now you can see everything without things getting squished!

## The Changes

Refactors `DebugSettings.swift` (209 lines changed) to wrap content in a ScrollView for better handling of the growing list of debug options.
