## The Translation

If someone sends "/think medium" by itself, that's just a command—there's nothing else to process. The AI shouldn't start thinking about... nothing!

This change recognizes when a message is ONLY a think directive. It treats it as a command (acknowledge and move on) rather than trying to generate a response about an empty question.

Smart parsing prevents silly behavior!

## The Changes

Treats messages that are only prefixed think directives (like "/think medium") as directive-only commands rather than prompts requiring AI responses.
