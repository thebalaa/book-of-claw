## The Translation

Version 1.2.0 is almost ready to release! This change cleans up the changelog, making sure everything is tidy and accurate.

There was also a small fix needed for the webhook—a missing import that could cause problems. It's like doing a final inspection before the grand opening.

Everything needs to be just right!

## The Changes

Refreshes the 1.2.0 changelog entries and fixes a webhook host import issue in the Twilio module.
