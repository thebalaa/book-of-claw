## The Translation

What if someone sends you three messages really fast? Before, the system would handle each one separately—three different thinking sessions.

Now it can "batch" them! It collects the rapid-fire messages and processes them together. "Here's everything they just said, respond to all of it."

It's like waiting until someone finishes their whole sentence before answering, instead of interrupting after every word!

## The Changes

Implements message batching for inbound web messages, collecting rapid consecutive messages and processing them together for more coherent responses.
