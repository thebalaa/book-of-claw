title: "Choosing Whether the Icon Does a Little Dance"

## The Translation

The little critter icon in the menu bar can wiggle, blink, and move its legs. Cute! But some people find animations distracting.

This commit adds a setting to turn icon animations on or off. If you like watching the critter wiggle while it works, keep it on. If you prefer a calm, still icon, turn it off.

The setting is in General preferences, and your choice is remembered between app launches. Animation lovers and minimalists can both be happy!

## The Changes

Adds icon animation toggle to `GeneralSettings.swift` and `AppState.swift`. Updates `MenuBar.swift` (23 lines) to respect the animation preference. Adds constant for the preference key.
