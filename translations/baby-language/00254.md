## The Translation

Oh no, a crash! The WebSocket (the connection to WhatsApp) could crash in certain situations. This fix catches that error and handles it gracefully instead of exploding.

Also, heartbeats now default to running every 10 minutes instead of... whatever they were before. Ten minutes is a nice balance—often enough to stay connected, not so often that it's wasteful.

The documentation got a major refresh too! Lots of improvements to make things clearer. When you fix bugs, it's a good time to also polish the docs.

## The Changes

Fixes a WebSocket crash scenario with proper error handling, sets the default heartbeat interval to 10 minutes, and significantly updates the Claude configuration documentation with clearer explanations and examples.
