## The Translation

Remember when we changed our tagline to match someone else's style? Well... we changed our mind. Our original tagline was actually better!

It's like trying on someone else's outfit and realizing "You know what? My style is MY style." We went back to what we had before.

One line change, switching back. And that's totally okay! Sometimes you need to try something new to realize the old way was right all along. The important thing is getting it right in the end.

## The Changes

Reverts the README tagline to the original version. Returns to the project's own styling after experimenting with an external format.
