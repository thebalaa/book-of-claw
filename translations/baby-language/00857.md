title: "System Presence for the Agent"

## The Translation

Where is the agent running? What providers are connected? System presence tracks this!

New infrastructure:
- `system-presence.ts` (48 lines) — tracks presence
- `system-events.ts` (33 lines) — emits events
- `provider-summary.ts` (59 lines) — summarizes providers

The agent now reports its presence across the system!

## The Changes

Adds system presence with system-presence.ts, system-events.ts, provider-summary.ts, and control channel updates.
