## The Translation

Sometimes when you add new stuff to a page, it gets a bit crowded. Like when you add more stickers to your notebook cover and it starts looking messy.

The About screen had some extra lines and spacing that made it look a bit cluttered. This quick cleanup removes 12 lines of unnecessary formatting — things like extra padding or redundant elements.

The information is all still there, it just looks tidier now. Like straightening up your desk after adding new supplies!

## The Changes

Removes 12 lines of redundant or excessive spacing/formatting from the AboutSettings view. Tidies up the metadata layout without changing functionality.
