title: "A Helper for Showing Time Age"

## The Translation

The menu shows health result age like "2m ago" or "5s ago". Calculating this is reusable — let's make a helper!

16 lines add an `ageString` function to Utilities. Now any code that needs to show time-since can use this helper.

## The Changes

Adds age string helper to `Utilities.swift` (16 lines) for displaying time-ago labels in the UI.
