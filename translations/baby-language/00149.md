title: "Telling Git to Ignore the Messy Closet"

## The Translation

You know how you might shove stuff in a closet before guests arrive? "Don't look in there!" The closet is useful for YOU, but nobody else needs to see that mess.

pnpm (our package manager) creates a folder called `.pnpm-store` where it keeps downloaded packages. It's useful for pnpm to have, but it shouldn't be saved in the project or uploaded anywhere.

We added one line to `.gitignore`: "Please ignore the .pnpm-store folder." Now Git won't try to save that folder. It's our little secret storage that stays on your machine.

## The Changes

Adds `.pnpm-store` to .gitignore to prevent the pnpm package cache directory from being tracked in version control.
