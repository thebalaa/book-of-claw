<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00068-134edc5e49-Silence Baileys session logs unless verbose-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter silenced the chatty Baileys library logs unless you turn on verbose mode. Baileys prints a lot of session management messages that aren't usually important.

Now those logs only appear when you specifically want them (with --verbose). Otherwise the program runs quietly.

It's like muting background music so you can focus on what's important.

## The Changes

This commit silenced Baileys logging:

- Configured Baileys logger to only print in verbose mode
- Suppressed routine session management logs
- Kept error logging always enabled
- Cleaner console output in normal operation

The program is now much quieter unless debugging is needed.
