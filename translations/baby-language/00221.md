## The Translation

Imagine you're on a phone call and neither person talks for a while. How do you know the other person is still there? You might say "hello? You still there?" every so often just to check!

That's what a "heartbeat" is for computers. The system now sends little "I'm still here!" signals to WhatsApp so the connection doesn't get sleepy and disconnect.

This change also adds "bounded reconnect" which is like having a rule: "If we get disconnected, try to reconnect—but don't keep trying forever. After a while, give up and tell someone there's a problem."

It's like giving your phone the smarts to know when to keep trying and when to stop and ask for help.

## The Changes

Adds heartbeat functionality to maintain active WhatsApp Web connections and implements bounded reconnection logic with configurable retry limits. Includes tuning options for heartbeat intervals and maximum reconnect attempts. Updates multiple modules to support these new connection management features.
