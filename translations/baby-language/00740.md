title: "Adaptive Voice Wake Timing"

## The Translation

People speak at different speeds! The voice wake delays should adapt to how fast you're talking.

26 new lines add adaptive delays:
- Faster speakers get shorter waits
- Slower speakers get more time
- The overlay adjusts too

Smarter, more natural interaction!

## The Changes

Adds adaptive voice wake delays to `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (9 lines) and `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (22 lines).
