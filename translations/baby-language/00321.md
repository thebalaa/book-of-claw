## The Translation

The CI (automated testing robot) was unhappy! It found lint issues and typing problems with the tau-rpc code.

This fix makes the robot happy again. The types are cleaner, the tests are fixed, and CI can give us a green checkmark.

Happy robot = working code!

## The Changes

Fixes CI failures by addressing lint errors and improving TypeScript typing in the tau-rpc module and redirect tests.
