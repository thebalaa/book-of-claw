## The Translation

What if Clawd is running on a different computer? Now you can connect to it remotely!

A new toggle lets you switch between local and remote mode:
- Configure the remote server URL
- Web chat connects to the remote instance
- Voice commands forward to the remote

314 new lines across 8 files add this powerful feature, plus new documentation in `docs/mac/remote.md`.

## The Changes

Adds remote Clawd toggle with UI in GeneralSettings, state management in AppState, utilities for connection, and documentation. 314 lines added across 8 files.
