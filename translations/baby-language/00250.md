## The Translation

The AI's identity prefix (the part that says "You are Claude..." or similar) should only appear at the beginning of conversations. This change adds more tests to make sure that rule is followed!

The tests check different scenarios: What if it's the first message? What if it's the third message? What if the session resets?

By testing all these cases, we make sure the identity prefix shows up exactly when it should—no more, no less.

## The Changes

Adds comprehensive tests covering the identity prefix gating logic, verifying that the prefix is correctly included on first turns and excluded on subsequent turns in a session.
