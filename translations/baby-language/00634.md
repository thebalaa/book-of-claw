title: "Delivering Messages Even with JSON Output"

## The Translation

The agent command has a `--json` flag for machine-readable output. But when this was on, message delivery was blocked!

The fix allows delivery to work even with JSON output mode. 18 lines added, 14 removed — a refactoring that enables both features to coexist.

## The Changes

Updates `agent.ts` (32 lines changed) to allow message delivery when JSON output mode is enabled.
