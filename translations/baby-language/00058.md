<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00058-9595964419-Add login alias for web QR and update docs-tests-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a `login` command (and updated the docs and tests). When you run `warelay login`, it shows the QR code for connecting to WhatsApp Web.

Before, you had to use a less obvious command. Now `login` is simple and self-explanatory - like most apps have a "login" button.

## The Changes

This commit added login alias:

- Created `login` command that displays WhatsApp Web QR code
- Updated documentation with login instructions
- Added tests for login command
- Made QR auth flow more discoverable

Users can now easily connect to WhatsApp Web with intuitive `warelay login` command.
