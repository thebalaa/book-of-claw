## The Translation

When a game is ready to release, it gets a version number. Like "Super Mario Bros. 1" or "Minecraft 1.0." The number tells everyone "this is official!"

We changed the version in `package.json` from whatever it was to `0.1.0`. This is the FIRST official release! The "0" means it's still early days, the "1" means first version, and the ".0" means no patches yet.

One line in one file, but it's a big moment. We're saying "This is ready for people to use!" Version numbers are like birthday candles — they mark milestones.

## The Changes

Sets the package version to 0.1.0 in preparation for the first npm release. Marks the project as ready for initial public distribution.
