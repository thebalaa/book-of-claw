## The Translation

This adds a helpful note to the AGENTS.md file (which gives guidance to AI helpers): if you're only adding tests, you don't need to update the changelog.

Why? Because tests don't change what the software does—they just verify it. Users don't need to know about every new test. The changelog is for user-facing changes.

Good guidelines make collaboration easier!

## The Changes

Adds a note to AGENTS.md clarifying that pure test additions don't require changelog entries, as they don't affect user-visible functionality.
