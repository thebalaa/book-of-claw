<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00059-3b8a31660b-Fix bailey auth import fallback and assert login alias-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter fixed how the program imports authentication utilities from the baileys library. Sometimes the import path changes between versions, so he added a fallback that tries multiple import paths until one works.

He also added assertions in tests to make sure the login alias actually exists and works.

It's like having multiple keys to try if the first one doesn't fit - eventually you find the right one.

## The Changes

This commit fixed baileys auth imports:

- Added fallback import paths for baileys auth utilities
- Handles different baileys versions gracefully
- Added test assertions for login command
- Made import logic more robust

The program now works with multiple versions of the baileys library.
