title: "Showing Raw Errors and Auto-Starting the Worker"

## The Translation

When RPC fails, the error message was being sanitized (cleaned up). But sometimes you need to see the RAW error to debug!

This fix:
- Shows the raw error lines as-is
- Auto-starts the RPC worker if it's not running

18 new lines make debugging easier and recovery automatic!

## The Changes

Updates `AgentRPC.swift` (24 lines changed) to surface raw error output and implement auto-start for the worker process.
