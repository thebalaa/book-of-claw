title: "Making the SSH Test Row More Compact"

## The Translation

The SSH test section in Voice Wake settings was taking up too much space. The button, status indicator, and info were spread out more than needed.

This refactoring makes it more compact — squishing things together nicely so it takes up less vertical space. Same information, smaller footprint. Like folding a letter to fit in a smaller envelope!

## The Changes

Refactors the SSH test row in `VoiceWakeSettings.swift` (46 lines changed, 24 added, 22 removed) for a more compact layout. Same functionality in less vertical space.
