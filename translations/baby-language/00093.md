## The Translation

Peter fixed TypeScript type errors that snuck in during recent refactoring. When you move code around a lot, sometimes types break. He fixed all the type errors and improved helper functions.

It's like fixing cracks that appear when you renovate a house - normal maintenance after big changes.

## The Changes

- Fixed TypeScript type errors
- Improved type definitions
- Fixed helper function signatures
- All type checks passing

TypeScript compilation is clean again.
