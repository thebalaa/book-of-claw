title: "A Special Tool for Reading Logs"

## The Translation

When your car breaks down, a mechanic uses special tools to see what's happening inside. Clawdis now has a similar tool!

`clawlog.sh` is a 309-line helper script that makes it easy to read the "unified logs" from macOS. These logs contain everything the app is doing.

The script can:
- Filter logs to show only Clawdis-related messages
- Color-code different types of messages (errors in red, etc.)
- Search for specific things
- Follow logs in real-time (like watching live)

When something goes wrong, run `clawlog.sh` and you can see exactly what happened!

## The Changes

Adds `scripts/clawlog.sh` (309 lines) — a comprehensive log viewing helper. Supports filtering, coloring, searching, and real-time following of macOS unified logs for Clawdis debugging.
