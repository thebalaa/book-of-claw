## The Translation

If the AI reads five files all from the same folder, listing them individually is redundant. This change collapses paths by directory!

Instead of listing each file with its full path, you might see "src/: file1.ts, file2.ts, file3.ts". Same info, much shorter.

Smart grouping reduces clutter!

## The Changes

Collapses verbose tool metadata paths by directory when multiple files from the same folder are involved.
