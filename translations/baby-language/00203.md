## The Translation

You know when you send a message and you see those little dots that mean "someone is typing..."? They're like a little heartbeat saying "don't worry, I'm still here thinking!"

Before this change, those dots would disappear after a few seconds, even if the computer was still working hard on your question. It was like leaving someone on hold with no music—you'd wonder if they hung up!

Now the computer keeps refreshing those typing dots while it's thinking. Every few seconds, it sends a little pulse that says "still here, still working!" It's like a friend saying "hold on, I'm looking it up..." while they search for an answer.

The dots keep blinking until the actual reply arrives. No more awkward silence!

## The Changes

Implements a typing indicator refresh interval during command execution. While waiting for a reply command to complete, the system periodically sends typing status updates (configurable via `typingIntervalSeconds`). This prevents the typing indicator from timing out during long-running operations, keeping users informed that processing is still ongoing.
