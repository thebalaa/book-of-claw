## The Translation

Imagine your house has a front door, and you can call it "the main entrance" or "the front door" — same door, different names. That can actually be useful!

The "webhook" command (the mailbox for receiving messages) was getting confusing with all its options. We unified how it works — one consistent way to set up the mailbox, regardless of which entrance you use.

We also kept `up` as an alias for tailscale, because people were used to typing that. PLUS we added 275 new lines of tests to make sure all these entry points work correctly!

## The Changes

Unifies webhook ingress handling and keeps `up` as a Tailscale alias for backward compatibility. Adds comprehensive tests for send, status, environment, and webhook commands.
