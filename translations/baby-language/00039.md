<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00039-fa1b357fd6-Log stderr and timeout info for auto-reply commands-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added more detailed logging when auto-reply commands fail or timeout.

When a command times out, the log now shows: "Command exceeded timeout of 30s" so you know why it failed.

When a command produces error output (stderr), it now logs that too: "Command stderr: [error message]". Before, only stdout was logged.

This makes debugging much easier - you can see exactly why a command failed (did it timeout? did it crash? what error did it print?) instead of just seeing "command failed" with no details.

## The Changes

This commit added stderr and timeout logging:

- Log stderr output when it exists (in verbose mode)
- When command times out, log "Command exceeded timeout of Xs"
- Improved error message clarity in catch blocks

Debugging auto-reply command failures is now much easier with detailed error information.
