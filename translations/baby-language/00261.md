## The Translation

Every good assistant needs a personality! This change adds a "session intro" for Clawd—a special introduction that tells the AI who it is and what it can do.

"You're Clawd, a helpful assistant. You can browse the web, check the weather, play music..." It's like giving someone a job description and a name tag on their first day.

With clear powers and personality defined, the AI knows how to behave from the very first message!

## The Changes

Adds a new session introduction template for Clawd that defines its personality traits and available capabilities/powers.
