<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00065-d501ac7acb-Show provider numbers in relay banner-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the program display your phone number when it starts up in relay mode. Now you can see at a glance which WhatsApp number you're connected to.

The startup banner now shows: "Relay mode: +1234567890 (via web)" or "Relay mode: +1234567890 (via Twilio)" so you always know what account you're using.

It's like your phone showing "Connected as: Your Name" when you open an app.

## The Changes

This commit added phone number to startup banner:

- Displays connected phone number on relay startup
- Shows provider type (web or Twilio)
- Added formatted banner with connection details
- Helpful for multi-account users

Users now see which number they're relaying messages for.
