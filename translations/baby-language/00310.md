## The Translation

When you receive or send pictures, each one gets an ID number. But the IDs weren't being handled consistently everywhere!

This fix makes sure media IDs work the same way throughout the code. Everything matches up now—no more confusion about which picture is which.

Consistency prevents bugs!

## The Changes

Fixes media serving and ID handling to ensure consistent behavior across the media server and store modules.
