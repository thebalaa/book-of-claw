## The Translation

If you trigger voice wake but don't say anything, there's nothing to send. Playing a "send" chime would be confusing!

2 lines add a check: only play the send chime when there's actually content to send.

## The Changes

Skips send chime when there's no content in `VoicePushToTalk.swift` (1 line) and `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (1 line).
