<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00051-343ef9b63d-Use lowercase warelay branding in README-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter changed the branding from "Warelay" to "warelay" (all lowercase) throughout the documentation. It's a minor style choice - lowercase looks more modern and matches how you type the command.

It's like choosing to write "iphone" instead of "iPhone" - a branding decision about capitalization.

## The Changes

This commit standardized branding to lowercase:

- Changed "Warelay" to "warelay" in README
- Updated all documentation references
- Kept command names lowercase-consistent

Branding is now consistently lowercase throughout the project.
