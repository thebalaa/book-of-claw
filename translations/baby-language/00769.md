title: "Easier SAG Installation"

## The Translation

SAG (speech-to-text) installation was a bit manual — you had to tap the Homebrew formula first. Now it auto-taps!

7 lines in ToolsSettings make installation smoother. Plus a doc update. Less friction!

## The Changes

Adds auto-tap for SAG installation in `ToolsSettings.swift` (7 lines) and updates docs (1 line).
