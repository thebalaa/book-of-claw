## The Translation

Partial replies (streaming text) work great in web chat, but on WhatsApp/Telegram they'd send multiple messages! Stop that.

108 lines added, 89 removed:
- Detect external surfaces
- Block partial replies for them
- Better tests for runtime guard

Only full replies go to external chat platforms!

## The Changes

Blocks partial replies on WhatsApp/Telegram surfaces. Updates command-reply, runtime-guard, and tests.
