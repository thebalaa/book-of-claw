<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00043-07f0a26419-Add messaging service webhook fallback- always log inbound-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added yet another fallback method for setting webhooks: via Messaging Services. Now the program tries four different approaches:

1. Channels Senders (raw request)
2. Channels Senders (SDK helper)
3. Incoming Phone Number
4. Messaging Service (new!)

Some Twilio accounts use Messaging Services instead of direct senders, so this new fallback handles those cases.

He also made sure inbound messages are always logged (even in non-verbose mode) so you never miss seeing what messages arrive.

## The Changes

This commit added messaging service webhook fallback:

- Added types for messaging services API
- Created `findMessagingServiceSid()` helper
- Added messaging service webhook update as 4th fallback method
- Ensures inbound messages always log to console
- Improved error messages for each fallback attempt

Webhook setup now works for even more Twilio account configurations.
