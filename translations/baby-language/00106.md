<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00106-54c763a679-chore- surface media URL in command prompts and tests-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made media URLs available in command prompts and added tests for this functionality. Now your auto-reply command receives both the media file path AND the URL if available.

This gives commands flexibility - they can use the local file or the URL depending on what works better.

## The Changes

- Exposed media URLs in template variables
- Added tests for media URL extraction
- Commands receive both file path and URL
- Better media handling in auto-replies

Commands now have access to both media files and URLs.
