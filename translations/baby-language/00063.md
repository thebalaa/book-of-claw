<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00063-7a5f5b8efe-Fix web auth detection and auto-restart after 515-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added auto-restart when WhatsApp Web disconnects (error code 515). Sometimes WhatsApp Web kicks you off and you need to log in again. Now the program detects this and automatically restarts the connection.

He also fixed how auth state is detected - making sure the program knows whether you're logged in or not.

It's like having your phone automatically reconnect to WiFi when it drops.

## The Changes

This commit added auto-restart on disconnect:

- Detects error 515 (connection closed by WhatsApp)
- Automatically restarts connection when kicked off
- Improved auth state detection
- Better handling of authentication status

Web provider now recovers automatically from disconnections.
