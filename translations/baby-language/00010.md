<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00010-3198caf430-Add -verbose flag- silence webhook logs by default-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter realized that when the webhook is running (listening for messages), it was printing a lot of messages to the screen every time something happened. It's like having a doorbell that doesn't just ring - it shouts "Someone pressed the doorbell! It was John! He pressed it at 2:30pm!"

Now it's quieter by default. The webhook still works perfectly, but it doesn't announce every little thing unless you specifically ask it to.

How? Peter added a `--verbose` flag (a special switch). By default, verbose is OFF, so the webhook runs quietly. But if you want to see all the details (for debugging or just out of curiosity), you can add `--verbose` when you start it:

- Without verbose: The webhook runs silently in the background
- With verbose: It prints "[INBOUND]" messages and "Auto-replied" confirmations

It's like a volume control - most of the time you want it quiet, but sometimes you need to turn it up to hear what's happening.

## The Changes

This commit added a `--verbose` flag to the webhook-related commands in `src/index.ts`:

- Created `GlobalOptions` type with `verbose` boolean property
- Modified `startWebhook()` function to accept a `verbose` parameter
- Wrapped console.log statements for inbound messages and auto-replies in `if (verbose)` conditionals
- Added `--verbose` option to the `webhook` command (defaults to false)
- Added `--verbose` option to the `setup` command (defaults to false)
- Updated both commands to pass the verbose flag to `startWebhook()`

The webhook still logs errors regardless of verbose setting, but routine operational messages (inbound message notifications and auto-reply confirmations) are now silent unless verbose mode is enabled. This reduces noise in production while preserving debugging capabilities.
