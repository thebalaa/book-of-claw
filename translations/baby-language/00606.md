## The Translation

The command resolver has multiple fallbacks — if it can't find `clawdis` in one place, it tries another. But are all those fallbacks working?

These 67 lines of tests check:
- Primary path works ✓
- First fallback works ✓
- Second fallback works ✓
- Returns nil when nothing found ✓

Test coverage = confidence!

## The Changes

Adds `CommandResolverTests.swift` (67 lines) testing the command resolver fallback paths.
