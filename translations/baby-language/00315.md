## The Translation

A "linter" is like a spelling and grammar checker for code. It found some things that could be written better!

This change fixes those lint errors. Maybe a variable was declared but never used, or something could be written more clearly. Now the linter is happy.

Clean code is happy code!

## The Changes

Fixes various Biome lint errors in command-reply, tau-rpc, and outbound modules to improve code quality.
