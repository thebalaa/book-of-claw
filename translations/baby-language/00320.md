## The Translation

When serving media files, the system sometimes creates temporary copies. But those temp files were sticking around after the response finished!

Now the code cleans up after itself. Once the file is sent, the temporary copy gets deleted. No more digital litter!

Clean up your toys when you're done playing.

## The Changes

Fixes media server to properly clean up temporary files after the response finishes sending, preventing accumulation of unused temp files.
