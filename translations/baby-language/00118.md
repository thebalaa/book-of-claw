## The Translation

You know those word search puzzles where you have to find hidden words in a bunch of letters? We needed to do something similar with pictures!

When someone sends a message with a picture, the picture's address might be hiding right in the middle of the text. Like: "Here's my cat MEDIA:/path/to/cat.jpg isn't she cute?"

The old code would miss those hidden picture addresses. Now we're much better at finding them, even when they're tucked between other words. We also taught the webhook (the mailbox that receives messages) to handle pictures from our website properly.

## The Changes

Improves MEDIA token parsing to handle inline tokens mixed with text. Updates the webhook to properly host media from web sources. Adds tests covering the new parsing behavior.
