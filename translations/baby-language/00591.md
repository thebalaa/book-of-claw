title: "Connecting the Chat Window to the Agent"

## The Translation

The web chat window is where you type messages. But those messages need to get to the agent! This was missing.

These 25 lines wire up the connection:
- When you send a message in the web chat
- It calls the CLI agent send command
- The message gets delivered to the AI

Now the chat window isn't just a pretty face — it actually talks to the agent!

## The Changes

Adds 25 lines to `WebChatWindow.swift` wiring the agent CLI send functionality into the web chat view's message handling.
