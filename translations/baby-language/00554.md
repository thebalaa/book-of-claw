## The Translation

The Voice Wake settings panel was getting crowded! With all the new features (triggers, SSH forwarding, test buttons), the content was getting too tall to fit on screen.

This refactoring makes the Voice Wake tab content scrollable. Now you can scroll up and down through all the settings without them getting squished or cut off.

The tab stays fixed at the top (from an earlier fix), but everything inside can scroll. Like having a long roll of paper that you can unroll to see more.

## The Changes

Refactors `VoiceWakeSettings.swift` (130 lines, 66 added, 64 removed) to wrap content in a ScrollView. Reorganizes the layout for better scrolling behavior while maintaining the fixed tab structure.
