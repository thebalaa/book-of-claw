<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00105-6d41df2941-feat- download inbound media and expose to templating-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added the ability to download inbound media (images sent TO you) and make them available to the auto-reply template system.

Now when someone sends you an image, your auto-reply command can access that image file. This enables powerful workflows like "describe this image" or "extract text from this photo."

The image gets downloaded and its path is passed to your command via templates.

## The Changes

- Downloads inbound media to temp files
- Exposes media file path in template variables
- Auto-reply commands can process received images
- Enables image-based workflows

Auto-reply commands can now process images people send you.
