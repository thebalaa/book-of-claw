## The Translation

Here's a fun feature! Sometimes you want the AI to think extra hard—to really ponder the question. The "ultrathink" marker signals this.

This change adds the ultrathink marker to heartbeat prompts. It's like putting a little flag on a question that says "This one's important—take your time and think deeply!"

The docs get updated to explain what ultrathink means and when it might be used.

## The Changes

Adds an ultrathink marker to heartbeat prompts, signaling to the AI model that extended thinking mode may be beneficial. Updates README and heartbeat documentation to explain the marker's purpose.
