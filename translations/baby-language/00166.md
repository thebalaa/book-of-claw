## The Translation

Have you ever read a book that says "for more details, see chapter 5"? That little reference saves you from having to repeat everything!

We have rules for AI agents in this project, but there are also SHARED rules that apply to ALL projects. Instead of writing them out again, we just added a note: "Hey, also check out those shared guardrails over there!"

One line. One reference. Now AI helpers know to look in multiple places for their instructions. Good documentation connects things together!

## The Changes

Adds a cross-reference in AGENTS.md pointing to shared agent guardrails documentation. Helps AI assistants find all relevant guidelines.
