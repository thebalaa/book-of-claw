## The Translation

Sometimes you're reading instructions and find a tiny typo. Like "teh" instead of "the." Not a big deal, but it bugs you until you fix it!

This is another quick README update. Just one line changed. Maybe a word was wrong, maybe a link was broken, maybe something was slightly off.

The beauty of version control (our save point system) is that even tiny fixes get recorded. We know exactly what changed and when. No fix is too small to track!

## The Changes

Minor README update — single line change for clarity or correction.
