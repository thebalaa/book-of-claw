<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00054-73a3463ec8-Unify relay entrypoint and default to web when available-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter unified the entry point and made the web provider the default choice (when available). Now when you run `warelay relay`, it automatically uses WhatsApp Web if you have it configured, otherwise it falls back to Twilio.

This makes sense because the web provider is free and doesn't require API keys. The program is smart enough to detect which provider you have set up and use the best one.

It's like a car that automatically switches between electric and gas mode based on what's available.

## The Changes

This commit unified provider logic and defaulted to web:

- Created unified `relay` command that auto-detects provider
- Web provider used first if credentials exist
- Falls back to Twilio if web not available
- Simplified command structure
- Auto-detection logic handles provider selection

Users don't need to manually choose provider - the program picks the best available option.
