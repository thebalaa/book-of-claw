## The Translation

You know those labels on containers that tell you what's inside? "Sugar," "Flour," "Rice." Without labels, you might put salt in your cookies by mistake!

In code, we use something called "types" as labels. They tell the computer "this box contains a number" or "this box contains text." Super important for avoiding mistakes!

During the big cleanup, some labels got lost. The "zod" typing (a label-making tool) and something called "ClaudeJsonParseResult" went missing. Oops! 

We put them back. Now everything is properly labeled again, and the computer knows exactly what each container holds.

## The Changes

Restores zod typing and imports the ClaudeJsonParseResult type that were accidentally removed during refactoring. Fixes type safety in the Claude integration code.
