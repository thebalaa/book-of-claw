## The Translation

The restart script couldn't find Node.js because it wasn't in the PATH. This adds the local node bin directory to the script's PATH.

Also includes:
- CHANGELOG updates
- Auto-reply improvements
- CLI enhancements

A big batch of improvements spread across 13 files!

## The Changes

Adds local node bin to restart script PATH. Updates CHANGELOG, README, webchat bundle, auto-reply, CLI, and docs across 13 files.
