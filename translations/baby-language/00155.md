## The Translation

Remember how we said testing is like shaking a Lego castle to make sure it's sturdy? Well, we just built a LOT more shake-tests!

ELEVEN new test files! That's 451 lines of brand new tests covering:
- The main program (does the CLI work?)
- The prompts (does asking questions work?)
- The tmux helper (does the special window work?)
- The webhook server (does receiving messages work?)
- And so much more!

It's like installing smoke detectors in every room of the house. If something goes wrong, we'll know about it quickly. The more tests we have, the more confident we can be that everything works!

## The Changes

Adds comprehensive test coverage across 11 new test files for CLI commands, infrastructure utilities, webhook handling, and provider integrations. Total of 451 new lines of tests.
