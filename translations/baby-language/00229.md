## The Translation

New feature, new documentation! The builder wrote a whole guide explaining what heartbeats are and how to use them.

The guide explains: "A heartbeat is a periodic check-in. You can set it up to run every few minutes and do things like check for updates, send reminders, or just keep connections alive."

The README gets updated too, with a quick mention of the feature. And the changelog notes this cool new ability.

Now anyone who wants to use heartbeats knows exactly how to set them up!

## The Changes

Adds comprehensive documentation for the heartbeat feature including a dedicated `docs/heartbeat.md` guide, README updates explaining the trigger mechanism, and changelog entries describing the new capability.
