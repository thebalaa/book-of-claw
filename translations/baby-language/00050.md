<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00050-dfd764fc71-Use generic phone examples in README-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter changed the README examples to use generic, obviously-fake phone numbers like +15551234567 instead of potentially real numbers. This is safer - you don't want people accidentally copying real phone numbers from examples.

It's like using "example@example.com" for email examples instead of a real email address.

## The Changes

This commit updated README with generic phone numbers:

- Changed all example phone numbers to +1555... format
- Ensured no real phone numbers appear in documentation
- Used clearly fake but properly formatted E.164 numbers

Documentation now uses safe, generic examples that won't accidentally contact real people.
