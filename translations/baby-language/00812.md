title: "Stable Close Button Hover"

## The Translation

The close button hover was flickering and getting clipped (cut off at the edges). Fix both!

10 lines stabilize the hover detection and ensure the button isn't clipped by the overlay bounds.

## The Changes

Stabilizes close button hover and prevents clipping in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (13 lines changed).
