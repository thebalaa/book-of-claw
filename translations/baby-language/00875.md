title: "No More Leaked SSH Processes"

## The Translation

When the app quits, SSH processes should stop too! Before, they could linger as "zombie" processes.

32 new lines ensure proper cleanup:
- AgentRPC cleans up (8 lines)
- MenuBar triggers cleanup (2 lines)
- WebChatWindow closes tunnels (25 lines)

Clean exit, no zombies!

## The Changes

Stops SSH process leaks on quit across AgentRPC (8 lines), MenuBar (2 lines), and WebChatWindow (25 lines).
