## The Translation

When showing conversation history, directives inside that history shouldn't re-trigger! "/new" in a quote from yesterday shouldn't reset today's session.

This fix ignores directives inside history blocks. The changelog notes this improvement.

## The Changes

Fixes directive detection to ignore matches inside quoted history blocks, preventing accidental re-triggering.
