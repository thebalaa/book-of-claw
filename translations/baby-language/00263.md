title: "Safer Defaults and Better Guards"

## The Translation

This change tweaks some default settings to be safer and adds a "guard" for the WebSocket connection.

A guard is like a watchdog—it checks that everything is okay before proceeding. If the WebSocket isn't ready, the guard prevents the code from trying to use it and crashing.

Better defaults + better guards = fewer surprises!

## The Changes

Adjusts heartbeat default values and adds a WebSocket guard check to prevent operations on uninitialized connections. Includes code formatting cleanup.
