## The Translation

When the AI finishes a "turn" (one complete thought/response), now that completion streams immediately. You don't wait for the whole process to finish.

The RPC timeout is also tighter—if things take too long, we know sooner.

## The Changes

Implements streaming of turn completions and tightens RPC timeout for better responsiveness.
