## The Translation

It's like the night before your birthday party! You've got to make sure everything is ready — decorations, cake, party favors...

Version 0.1.0 is coming! This is the first "real" version that people will use. We needed to:
1. Write down what's new (that's the CHANGELOG — a diary of changes)
2. Update the README with instructions focused on npm (how to install and use it)

34 lines of changelog explaining all the cool features. 17 lines of README improvements showing people how to get started. The party is almost ready!

## The Changes

Prepares for version 0.1.0 release by adding comprehensive changelog entries and updating README with npm-focused quickstart instructions.
