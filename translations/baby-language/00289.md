## The Translation

Two bugs squashed in one commit!

First: when the AI had nothing to say, the code was dumping empty JSON weirdly. Now it handles the "nothing here" case properly.

Second: heartbeat messages were missing their prefix. Now they get the proper formatting like everything else.

Small fixes, but they make everything work more smoothly!

## The Changes

Fixes empty result JSON dump handling when no response content exists, and ensures heartbeat messages correctly receive their configured prefix.
