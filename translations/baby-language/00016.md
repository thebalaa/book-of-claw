<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00016-52b0c6252d-Add -y-yes to auto-confirm prompts- verbose keeps showing command output-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a way to skip all the "Are you sure?" questions. You know how programs sometimes ask you "Do you want to continue? [Y/n]" and you have to type Y each time? Now you can tell the program up front: "Just say yes to everything."

He added the `-y` flag (or `--yes` if you want to spell it out). When you use this flag, anytime the program would normally ask you a yes-or-no question, it automatically says yes instead of stopping and waiting for you.

It's like giving someone a permission slip that says "Yes to everything" instead of having to sign each individual form. This is really handy for scripts or when you're running the program over and over and don't want to keep answering the same questions.

Behind the scenes, Peter created a `globalYes` variable (like a light switch) and a `setYes()` function to flip it on or off. Then he updated `promptYesNo()` (the question-asker) to check: "If globalYes is on, just return true without asking."

Both the `webhook` and `setup` commands now accept `-y` or `--yes` as an option.

## The Changes

This commit added auto-confirmation of prompts:

- Created `globalYes` variable to track auto-confirm state
- Created `setYes()` function to enable/disable auto-confirm
- Modified `promptYesNo()` to return `true` immediately when `globalYes` is enabled
- Added `yes` property to the `GlobalOptions` type
- Added `-y, --yes` option to both `webhook` and `setup` commands
- Both commands now call `setYes()` to enable auto-confirm when the flag is used

This allows unattended operation and scripting by bypassing interactive prompts when the user specifies `-y` or `--yes`.
