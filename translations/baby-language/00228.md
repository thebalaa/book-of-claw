## The Translation

The system already had heartbeats to keep connections alive. But what if YOU want to trigger a heartbeat check from the command line?

Now you can! There's a new "heartbeat" command that lets you manually poke the system and say "Hey, check in with everyone right now!"

But that's not all—the heartbeat can also trigger auto-replies! It's like having an alarm clock that not only wakes you up, but also reminds you to check your messages. The system can periodically check if there's anything it needs to respond to, even if no new message came in.

This is a big change with lots of new code to make it all work smoothly.

## The Changes

Adds a `heartbeat` CLI command for manual heartbeat triggers and integrates heartbeat-triggered auto-reply functionality. The relay can now periodically invoke the reply flow even without new inbound messages, enabling proactive behaviors like scheduled checks or status updates. Includes extensive tests for the new functionality.
