title: "A Better Home for Log Files"

## The Translation

Log files need to live somewhere. The `/tmp` folder is perfect because:
- It's always there on every Mac
- It gets cleaned up automatically
- It doesn't clutter your home folder

This change makes `/tmp/clawdis` the default location for pino logs. Now all log files go to a predictable, clean location that everyone can find easily.

## The Changes

Updates `src/logging.ts` (3 lines changed) to use `/tmp/clawdis` as the default directory for pino log files.
