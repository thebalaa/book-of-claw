title: "Node Commands vs Mac Helper Commands"

## The Translation

Some commands run on a remote Node.js server, others run locally via the Mac helper. They needed to be split properly!

49 lines add clear separation between:
- Commands that run on the remote clawdis node
- Commands that run via the local Mac helper

## The Changes

Updates `Utilities.swift` (52 lines changed) to split clawdis node commands from Mac helper commands.
