## The Translation

When you have a pet, you need rules. "No biting. Stay off the couch. Come when called." Rules help everyone get along!

AI assistants (like Claude) that might work with this code also need rules. What files can they change? What should they be careful about? How should they behave in this project?

We added 35 lines to AGENTS.md spelling out guidelines for AI helpers. Things like "here's how this repo is organized" and "here's what to be careful about." Now when an AI comes to help, it knows the house rules!

## The Changes

Adds repository-specific guidelines to AGENTS.md for AI assistants. Includes information about project structure, conventions, and guardrails for automated helpers.
