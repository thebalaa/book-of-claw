title: "Asking the CLI What Version It Is"

## The Translation

"What version of the app do you have?" is a really common question when troubleshooting problems. But the command-line tool didn't have an easy way to tell you!

Now you can type `clawdis --version` (or `-v` for short) and it will tell you exactly what version you're running. Like asking a toy robot "What model are you?" and it responds "I am Robot-3000 version 2.5!"

This is super helpful for:
- Debugging problems ("Oh, you're on version 1.2, there's a bug in that version")
- Checking if you have the latest update
- Reporting issues to the developers

## The Changes

Adds `--version` and `-v` flags to ClawdisCLI. Displays the current version number when invoked. 14 new lines added to handle version display.
