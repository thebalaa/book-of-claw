title: "Showing When Media Downloads Fail"

## The Translation

Sometimes downloading a picture fails. Maybe the link is broken, maybe the server is down. Instead of silently failing, now these errors bubble up!

The user can see "Couldn't download that media" instead of just... nothing. Transparency is better than mystery failures.

## The Changes

Surfaces media fetch failures in web auto-reply so users know when media downloads fail rather than silently failing.
