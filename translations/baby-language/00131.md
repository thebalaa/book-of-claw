## The Translation

You know how sometimes your room gets SO messy with old toys and new toys mixed together? And then you clean it up, throw away the broken stuff, and suddenly everything makes sense?

The MEDIA parsing code was like that messy room. It had 81 lines of complicated logic, with lots of "if this, then that, but also check this other thing." Confusing!

We simplified everything: 48 lines of old complicated code became 33 lines of clean, simple code. Bad picture addresses get thrown out. Good ones are kept. No more confusion. Marie Kondo would be proud!

## The Changes

Refactors the MEDIA parsing module to be simpler and more robust. Removes redundant code, drops invalid lines cleanly, and keeps only valid tokens. Net reduction of 15 lines.
