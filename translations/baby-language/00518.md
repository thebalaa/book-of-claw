## The Translation

Sometimes finding something takes multiple tries. Maybe your favorite toy isn't in your room, so you check the living room, then the backyard, then your friend's house.

The relay launcher got much smarter about finding the `clawdis` program. Now it tries three different strategies:

1. **First**, look for `clawdis` directly — maybe it's installed globally
2. **If that fails**, try using `pnpm` (a package manager) to run it
3. **Last resort**, find `node` and run the JavaScript file directly

It also knows to look in more places: the project's own `node_modules`, the pnpm library folder, and all the usual system paths. It's like having a treasure map with multiple X marks — if one spot is empty, try the next!

## The Changes

Enhances relay executable resolution with three fallback strategies: direct `clawdis` binary, `pnpm clawdis relay`, or `node bin/warelay.js relay`. Adds `findExecutable(named:)` helper and `defaultProjectRoot()` to locate the project directory. Expands `preferredPaths()` to include `node_modules/.bin` and `~/Library/pnpm`.
