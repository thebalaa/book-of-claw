## The Translation

Have you ever tried to tell someone how to do their job when they already know how? It's kind of silly, right?

We were giving the pnpm helper robot very detailed instructions about where to put things and how to set up. But guess what? The pnpm robot already knows the best way to do all that stuff!

So we removed seven lines of us trying to be bossy and just said "Do your thing." The robot uses its own smart defaults now. Sometimes the best help is getting out of the way.

## The Changes

Removes manual PNPM_HOME configuration from CI workflow. The pnpm/action-setup action handles this automatically with sensible defaults.
