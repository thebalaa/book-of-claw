title: "Finding Clawdis Through pnpm and node"

## The Translation

Clawdis can be installed different ways — globally, through pnpm, or just via node. The health check wasn't checking all these paths!

This fix makes the locator smarter:
- First try the direct `clawdis` command
- Then try `pnpm clawdis`
- Then try `node` with the script path

15 new lines in Utilities to search more thoroughly.

## The Changes

Enhances CLI resolution in `Utilities.swift` (15 lines) to check pnpm and node fallback paths for finding clawdis.
