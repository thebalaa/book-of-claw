<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00084-fdfb1df0de-feat- add dry-run options and retry helper-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter expanded dry-run support to more commands and created a generic retry helper that can be reused across the codebase.

The retry helper uses exponential backoff and can be applied to any operation that might fail temporarily.

## The Changes

- Extended dry-run to more commands
- Created reusable retry helper function
- Added configurable retry attempts and backoff
- Applied retry logic consistently

More operations now support dry-run testing and automatic retries.
