## The Translation

The web chat window is a complex piece of the app. When things go wrong, how do you figure out what happened?

This documentation explains:
- How to enable auto-open for debugging
- How to read the verbose logs
- What the different log messages mean
- Common problems and solutions

It's 28 lines of helpful instructions that will save developers hours of confusion. When something breaks, they can follow the debug guide instead of guessing!

## The Changes

Adds `docs/mac/webchat.md` (28 lines) documenting the webchat auto-open feature and debug workflow for troubleshooting the embedded chat window.
