## The Translation

Ever tried to send a huge photo through text message and it took forever? Or the app said "file too big"? Big images are a problem!

When the auto-reply sends pictures, they could be MASSIVE. High-resolution photos might be 10 megabytes! That makes messages slow and can hit size limits.

So we added compression — squishing the pictures to make them smaller, like vacuum-sealing a pillow. The image still looks good, but it's much smaller and sends faster. This is a big change: 275 new lines, with lots of tests!

## The Changes

Adds media compression for auto-reply images. Automatically resizes and compresses images before sending to reduce file sizes and improve delivery speed. Includes extensive test coverage.
