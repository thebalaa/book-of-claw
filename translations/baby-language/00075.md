<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00075-5c5a103abb-docs- broaden README for web provider-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter updated the README to give equal weight to the web provider and Twilio provider. Before, the docs focused mainly on Twilio. Now they explain both options clearly from the start.

This makes sense since the web provider is free and many users will prefer it.

## The Changes

This commit broadened README for web:

- Added web provider to quickstart section
- Explained both provider options upfront
- Reorganized docs to be provider-neutral
- Highlighted that web provider is free

Documentation now treats both providers as first-class options.
