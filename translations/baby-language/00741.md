## The Translation

When you say "Hey Clawdis, what's the weather?", the overlay should show "what's the weather?" — not the trigger phrase itself!

18 lines add trimming to remove the trigger phrase from the displayed transcript. Cleaner, more relevant display!

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (22 lines changed) to trim the trigger phrase from the displayed transcript.
