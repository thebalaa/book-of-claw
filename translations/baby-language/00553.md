## The Translation

SSH addresses can be written different ways:
- `user@host`
- `host`
- `user@host:port`
- `ssh://user@host:port`

The old parser didn't handle all these well. If you typed something slightly different, it might get confused or show a unhelpful error.

This fix improves the parsing to:
- Handle more address formats
- Give clearer error messages when something is wrong
- Show exactly what part of the address has a problem

Now when you make a typo in your SSH target, the error message actually helps you fix it!

## The Changes

Improves SSH target parsing in `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (44 lines changed). Handles more address formats and provides detailed error messages. Also updates CLI (4 lines) with related improvements.
