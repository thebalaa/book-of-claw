## The Translation

When you change a math problem, you have to change the answer sheet too! If the question was "2+2" and the answer was "4", but now you changed it to "2+3", the answer needs to become "5."

We just did a big cleanup of the source code. But the tests (the answer sheets that check if code works) were still expecting the OLD code's behavior!

Ten test files got updated. We changed them to match how the code works NOW. Some tests got simpler, some got new checks added. Now when we run the tests, they actually test the right things!

## The Changes

Updates test files across the codebase to sync with the recent source code refactoring. Adjusts expectations and mocks in 10 test files to match current implementations.
