## The Translation

Pictures come in different formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP... Like how music comes in MP3, WAV, FLAC. Each format is a bit different!

Does our image compression work with ALL these formats? We'd better test! So we added 151 new lines of tests that try different image types.

We also documented the resize limits in the config docs. "Here's how big images can be, and here's how to change that limit." Now we're confident the feature works with all common image formats!

## The Changes

Adds test coverage for various media formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.) and documents resize cap configuration in docs. Ensures media handling works correctly across different image types.
