title: "Fixing Payload Types in CI"

## The Translation

CI found some type issues with how payloads (the data being sent) are handled in command-reply. TypeScript was confused about what shape the data should be.

This fix clarifies the types. Now TypeScript understands "a payload can be one message or multiple messages" and stops complaining.

## The Changes

Fixes TypeScript typing for command-reply payloads to properly handle both single and multi-message response formats, resolving CI errors.
