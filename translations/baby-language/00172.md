## The Translation

When you're in a group project and everyone has different title styles, it looks messy. "MY TITLE" vs "My Title" vs "my title." Better if everyone matches!

There's someone named steipete with a similar project, and their tagline format looked nice. We adjusted our header to match that style — consistent with how other similar projects look.

It's like making sure all the houses on a street have similar mailboxes. Each house is unique, but there's a coherent style. One line change, but now we fit in with the neighborhood!

## The Changes

Aligns README header formatting with steipete's similar project style. Improves consistency with related open source projects.
