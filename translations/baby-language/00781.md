title: "Cleaner Label Without Background"

## The Translation

The label had its own background, which was redundant with the overlay's background. Simplify!

7 lines added, 20 removed:
- Label wraps to overlay width
- No more separate label background
- Cleaner, simpler code

## The Changes

Removes label background and improves wrapping in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (27 lines changed, net -13 lines).
