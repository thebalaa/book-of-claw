<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00092-13be898c07-feat- serialize command auto-replies with queue-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a queue for command-based auto-replies. Before, if multiple messages came in quickly, the program would run multiple commands simultaneously. Now they run one at a time in order.

This prevents resource overload and ensures responses are processed sequentially. It's like a line at a coffee shop - customers are served one at a time, not all at once.

## The Changes

- Created auto-reply command queue
- Commands now execute serially, not in parallel
- Prevents resource exhaustion from simultaneous commands
- Maintains message order

Command auto-replies now execute one at a time in a queue.
