title: "No Prefix for Heartbeat OK"

## The Translation

"HEARTBEAT_OK" is a special response that just means "everything is fine, nothing to report." It's not really a message to anyone.

Adding a response prefix (like "🤖: ") to "HEARTBEAT_OK" would look weird: "🤖: HEARTBEAT_OK" — what?

This change skips the prefix for those special heartbeat responses. They're internal signals, not real conversation.

## The Changes

Skips the response prefix for HEARTBEAT_OK responses since they are internal status messages rather than user-facing conversation.
