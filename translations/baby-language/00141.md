## The Translation

When you're packing for a trip, do you have a checklist? Toothbrush? Underwear? Phone charger? It helps make sure you don't forget anything important!

Software projects need checklists too, especially when releasing a new version. Did we update the version number? Did we write what changed? Did we test everything?

We created a new file called `RELEASING.md` with 35 lines of instructions — a step-by-step checklist for shipping a new version. Now nobody has to remember all the steps; they're written down. And we tweaked the tagline in the README to sound just right.

## The Changes

Adds a release checklist document (docs/RELEASING.md) with step-by-step instructions for publishing new versions. Also adjusts the README tagline.
