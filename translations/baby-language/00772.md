title: "Don't Block the Main Thread!"

## The Translation

Some operations (launchctl commands, webchat loading) were blocking the main thread. That freezes the UI — bad!

59 lines move this blocking work to background threads:
- App stays responsive
- UI doesn't freeze
- Better user experience

Performance improvement through proper concurrency!

## The Changes

Moves blocking launchctl and webchat work off main thread in AppState (11 lines), Utilities (36 lines), and WebChatWindow (42 lines).
