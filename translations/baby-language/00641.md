title: "Cleaner UI While Sending"

## The Translation

The helper text below buttons can be distracting when an action is in progress. "Click to send" is confusing when you already clicked!

This hides the helper subtext while a send operation is running. The UI looks cleaner and less confusing during active operations.

## The Changes

Updates `DebugSettings.swift` (26 lines changed) to hide helper subtext during send operations.
