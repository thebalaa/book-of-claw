## The Translation

You know how you might hide your Halloween candy in a special spot so you can find it later? Computers do the same thing — they save stuff they've downloaded so they don't have to get it again.

The helper robot knew it should save things to find later, but it forgot *where* to look! It was checking the wrong hiding spot.

We added one little note that says "Hey, your saved stuff is over HERE." Now the robot doesn't waste time downloading things it already has. It just grabs them from its stash!

## The Changes

Adds explicit pnpm cache path configuration for the setup-node action so it correctly finds and uses the cached dependencies.
