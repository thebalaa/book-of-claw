## The Translation

The CLI had different code paths for different providers (WhatsApp, Telegram). Messy!

This unification:
- Merges provider handling
- Adds heartbeat flag
- Cleaner architecture

291 lines changed in program.ts alone — a significant refactoring that makes the code easier to maintain!

## The Changes

Unifies relay providers in CLI and adds heartbeat flag. Updates program.ts (291 lines), tests, and documentation.
