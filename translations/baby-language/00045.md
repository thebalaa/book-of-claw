<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00045-3c8a105165-Add WhatsApp Web provider option and docs-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a completely new way to connect to WhatsApp: using WhatsApp Web instead of Twilio!

Before, the program only worked with Twilio (which costs money). Now you can use WhatsApp Web for free - it connects directly to WhatsApp using the same method the web interface uses.

This is a big feature! It means you can run the program without needing a Twilio account at all. You just scan a QR code with your phone (like logging into WhatsApp Web in your browser) and you're connected.

The code now supports two "providers": Twilio (the original way) and Web (the new free way).

## The Changes

This commit added WhatsApp Web provider support:

- Added provider abstraction layer to support multiple backends
- Implemented web provider using @whiskeysockets/baileys library
- Added QR code display for WhatsApp Web login
- Updated docs to explain both provider options
- Made Twilio optional - can now use web provider exclusively

Users can now choose between paid Twilio service or free WhatsApp Web connection.
