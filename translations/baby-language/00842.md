## The Translation

When connecting to a remote relay, prefer the runtime installed on the host system!

20 new lines add logic to check for and prefer the host's runtime. Better compatibility with remote setups.

## The Changes

Updates `Utilities.swift` (23 lines changed) to prefer host runtime for remote relay connections.
