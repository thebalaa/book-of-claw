## The Translation

We added all these amazing media features — images, audio, video, documents. But did we write good instructions for all of them?

Time for a documentation sweep! This commit touches:
- The CHANGELOG (what's new?)
- The README (quick overview)
- Audio docs (how does audio work?)
- Config docs (what settings exist?)
- Image docs (picture handling)
- Tests (making sure it all works)

We tidied up the tests too, making them cleaner and more organized. Now the documentation matches the features, and everything is properly explained. This is the finishing touch!

## The Changes

Documents media caps, updates multiple documentation files, and tidies web provider tests. Ensures all new media features are properly documented and tested.
