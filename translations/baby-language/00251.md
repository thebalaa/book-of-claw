## The Translation

The CI (Continuous Integration) is like a robot that checks your work every time you submit it. It runs all the tests automatically to make sure nothing is broken.

This robot was complaining! There were some type errors (places where the code didn't match its promises) and a media check that wasn't working right.

This fix patches up those issues so the CI robot is happy again and gives us a green checkmark. ✅

## The Changes

Fixes CI failures by addressing TypeScript type gaps and correcting the hasMedia check logic in the web auto-reply module.
