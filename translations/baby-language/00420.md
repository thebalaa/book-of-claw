## The Translation

When the RPC returns nothing, we shouldn't echo the prompt back! That would be confusing—you'd see your own question repeated.

This fix detects empty returns and stays quiet instead of echoing.

## The Changes

Fixes prompt echoing when RPC returns empty results, with test coverage.
