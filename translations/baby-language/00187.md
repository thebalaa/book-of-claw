## The Translation

Imagine you have to write your phone number in five different places. If you change your number, you have to update ALL five. Annoying, and you might forget one!

The version number was written in multiple files. Every release, someone had to change it in several places. Easy to mess up!

Now we read the version from ONE place: `package.json`. A new file called `version.ts` reads it from there, and everyone else asks `version.ts`. Change it once, it's correct everywhere. That's called "single source of truth" — and it's way smarter!

## The Changes

Refactors version handling to derive from package.json. Adds version.ts module that reads the version centrally, eliminating duplicate version strings.
