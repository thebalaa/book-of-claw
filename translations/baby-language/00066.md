<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00066-b4e5f20cd7-Add claudeOutputFormat support and provider banners-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a `claudeOutputFormat` config option. When using Claude as your auto-reply command, you can now specify whether you want JSON output or plain text output.

Some people want structured JSON (for parsing), others want plain readable text. Now you can choose.

He also improved the provider startup banners to show more information about your connection.

## The Changes

This commit added Claude output format config:

- Added `claudeOutputFormat` field to config (json|text)
- Updated auto-reply to respect output format preference
- Improved provider banners with more details
- Better logging of connection status

Users can now configure how Claude formats its responses.
