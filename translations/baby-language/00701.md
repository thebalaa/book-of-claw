## The Translation

UI polish time! Tables get tidied, links get better styling, and the redundant voice wake forwarder section gets hidden.

15 lines added, 21 removed across 4 files. The settings screens look cleaner and more professional now!

## The Changes

Tidies tables in SessionsSettings and ToolsSettings, removes redundant forwarder from VoiceWakeSettings. Minor bundle update.
