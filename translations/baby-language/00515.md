## The Translation

Imagine you're trying to find your friend to play, but you only know they live "somewhere on Maple Street." That's not very helpful! You need actual addresses to check.

The relay (that messenger program) had this problem. Clawdis knew it needed to run `clawdis relay`, but sometimes it couldn't find where that program actually lived on the computer. Different computers put things in different places!

This fix teaches Clawdis to be a better detective. Instead of just guessing, it now checks several common hiding spots: `/opt/homebrew/bin` (where Mac programs often live), `/usr/local/bin`, and other usual places. It builds a list of addresses and checks each one until it finds its friend.

Also, when asking for Accessibility permissions (so it can control your computer), it now actually shows the permission popup instead of just checking quietly. Much more helpful!

## The Changes

Hardened relay process spawning by searching multiple paths for the `clawdis` executable. Added `preferredPaths()` and `findExecutable()` helpers. Sets PATH environment variable with those paths. Also fixed Accessibility permission prompt to actually show the dialog by passing `AXTrustedCheckOptionPrompt: true`.
