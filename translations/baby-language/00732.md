## The Translation

The webchat architecture changed — no more CLI spawning. The documentation needs to reflect this!

5 lines added, 4 removed across 3 docs files. Now the docs match reality.

## The Changes

Updates remote, webchat, and Mac webchat documentation to reflect in-process serving (no CLI spawn).
