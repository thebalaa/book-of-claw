## The Translation

The attributed text (with formatting) had color attributes embedded. These were overriding the primary text color!

12 lines strip out the color attributes so the text uses the system's primary color consistently.

## The Changes

Strips label color attributes in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (15 lines changed) for consistent primary color usage.
