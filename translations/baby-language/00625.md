## The Translation

The recognition language dropdown (where you pick English, Spanish, etc.) had slightly different styling than its neighbors. Time to fix that!

4 lines make it match the rest of the Voice Wake settings. Consistency is key to a polished look.

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeSettings.swift` (5 lines changed) to align the recognition language row styling with other rows.
