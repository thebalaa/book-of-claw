## The Translation

Log files can grow HUGE if you never clean them up. This change adds automatic log rotation!

Every day, a new log file starts. Old logs get deleted after 24 hours. It's like throwing away yesterday's newspaper—you don't need to keep them forever.

This keeps your disk from filling up with old logs. Clean and organized!

## The Changes

Implements daily log rotation and automatic pruning of logs older than 24 hours to prevent unbounded log file growth.
