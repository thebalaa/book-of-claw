## The Translation

Want to send an image through the web chat? Now you can! Attachments get "inlined" — converted to data that travels with the message.

63 lines add attachment support:
- Bootstrap (10 lines) handles the UI
- Server (57 lines) processes and forwards attachments

Also fixes some status compile issues.

## The Changes

Adds attachment inline support to `bootstrap.js` (10 lines) and `server.ts` (57 lines) for agent RPC.
