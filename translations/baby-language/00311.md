title: "Making Claude Identity Universal"

## The Translation

The Claude identity (how the AI introduces itself) had some user-specific stuff in it. But the code should work for everyone, not just one person!

This change makes the Claude identity "user-agnostic"—it works the same for everyone without any personalized bits baked in.

## The Changes

Adjusts Claude identity configuration to be user-agnostic, removing any user-specific references so the code works universally.
