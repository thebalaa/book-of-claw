<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00055-52e0c8de25-Fix lint warnings and tighten test mocks-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter fixed all the Biome linter warnings (the code style checker was complaining about things) and improved the test mocks to be more accurate.

Mocks are fake versions of real objects used in tests. Better mocks mean more reliable tests. He made sure the mocks match the real API shapes more closely.

It's like cleaning up all the small messes in your code - fixing typos, aligning formatting, and making test data more realistic.

## The Changes

This commit cleaned up linting and testing:

- Fixed all Biome lint warnings
- Tightened TypeScript types in test mocks
- Improved mock accuracy to match real APIs
- Removed unused variables and imports
- Better type safety in test files

Code now passes all linting checks and tests are more reliable.
