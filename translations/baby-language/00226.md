## The Translation

Remember how we added helpful hints to timeout messages, like "I was in this folder when time ran out"? Well, someone needs to make sure those hints actually appear!

This change adds tests that specifically check: "When a command times out, does the error message include the folder path? Does it include the queue information?" 

The tests pretend to run slow commands that time out, then look at the error message and say "Yep, all the helpful info is there!"

It's like checking that your error messages are actually helpful, not just "Something broke. Good luck!"

## The Changes

Adds test coverage for the timeout error message enhancements, verifying that the current working directory (cwd) hint and queue metadata are properly included in command timeout errors.
