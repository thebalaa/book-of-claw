## The Translation

All this tool formatting and debouncing (waiting to batch) code was getting complicated. Time to give it its own file!

This "refactor" extracts the tool-meta code into `tool-meta.ts`. Now the main command-reply file is simpler, and the formatting logic has a dedicated home.

Organization makes code maintainable!

## The Changes

Extracts tool metadata formatting and debouncing logic into a dedicated `tool-meta.ts` module, simplifying the command-reply file.
