title: "What if We Can't Find the CLI?"

## The Translation

The health check needs to run the CLI. But what if the CLI isn't installed yet? Before, it would just crash or hang.

Now it handles this gracefully: "CLI not found" shows as a health issue instead of breaking. 12 lines make the health check more resilient!

## The Changes

Adds handling for missing CLI in `HealthStore.swift` (6 lines) and `Utilities.swift` (7 lines) for graceful degradation.
