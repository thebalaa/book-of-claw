## The Translation

The builder looked at the changelog entry and thought "Hmm, this has too many details that users don't care about."

People using the software want to know "what changed that affects me?" They don't need to know about every little internal reorganization. So the builder trimmed the note to just the important parts—the stuff that actually matters to users.

It's like telling someone "I cleaned up the attic" instead of describing every single box you moved.

## The Changes

Simplifies the changelog entry to focus on user-facing changes, removing internal implementation details about the module split that don't affect end users.
