title: "Showing Bootstrap Errors in the Chat"

## The Translation

When the web chat fails to start (bootstrap errors), users need to know! Before, it would just show a blank screen.

10 lines add error display so you can see what went wrong during initialization.

## The Changes

Updates `WebChatWindow.swift` (11 lines) to surface bootstrap errors in the web chat UI.
