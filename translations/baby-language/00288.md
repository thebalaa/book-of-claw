## The Translation

The watchdog that checks for stuck sessions was barking too quickly! It was saying "something's wrong!" after just a few minutes, but sometimes things just take a while.

This change increases the timeout to 30 minutes. Now the watchdog waits patiently for half an hour before raising the alarm.

It's like giving the pizza delivery guy more time before you call to ask where your food is.

## The Changes

Increases the watchdog timeout from a shorter interval to 30 minutes, allowing more time for long-running operations before triggering recovery actions.
