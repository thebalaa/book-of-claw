title: "Installing the Helper With Permission"

## The Translation

Some things on your computer require special permission. Like how you need a parent's permission to install a new app.

Clawdis has a command-line helper tool (CLI) that needs to be installed in a special protected folder (`/usr/local/bin`). To put files there, you need "administrator" permission — like having the master key.

Before, the app tried to install this helper directly, which sometimes failed. Now it uses `osascript` — a special macOS tool that can pop up a password dialog asking "This app wants to make changes. Enter your password."

When you enter your password, it runs the installation with proper permissions. This is the safe, Mac-approved way to do things that need extra access!

## The Changes

Refactors CLI helper installation in `Utilities.swift` to use `osascript` for privileged operations. Displays a proper macOS authentication dialog instead of failing silently or requiring manual sudo. Adds 41 lines for the improved installer flow.
