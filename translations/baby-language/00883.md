## The Translation

The remote SSH config was complex and rarely changed. Drop it! Also harden template parsing.

92 lines removed, 57 added:
- Remove SSH config options (25 lines from AppState)
- Harden template parsing (86 lines in forwarder)
- Simplify tests

Cleaner, more robust code!

## The Changes

Drops remote SSH config and hardens template parsing across AppState, Utilities, forwarder, and tests.
