## The Translation

When you make a drawing, you might write the date on it: "Made on Tuesday, February 15th." That way, you know exactly when you created it!

The About screen in Clawdis now shows build information:
- When the app was compiled (the build timestamp)
- What version it is
- The commit hash (like a unique fingerprint for the code)

This is super helpful for debugging. If something goes wrong, you can look at the About screen and say "Oh, this was built 3 days ago with commit abc123." Then you know exactly what code is running.

The information comes from the app's Info.plist file, which gets stamped during the build process.

## The Changes

Adds build metadata display to the AboutSettings view: version string, build timestamp, and optionally Git commit hash. Reads `BUILD_TIMESTAMP` and `GIT_COMMIT` from the app's Info.plist bundle. Shows this info below the version number in the About panel.
