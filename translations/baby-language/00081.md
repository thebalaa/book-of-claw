<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00081-1f5390ed99-chore- route port error debug through logger-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter updated port error handling to use the new logger instead of raw console.error. This makes port conflict messages consistent with the rest of the logging system.

Continuing the logger migration - every output statement going through the centralized system.

## The Changes

- Updated port error handler to use logger
- Consistent log formatting for port conflicts
- Better integration with verbosity controls

Port errors now follow the same logging patterns as everything else.
