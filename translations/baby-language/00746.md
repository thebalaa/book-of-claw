## The Translation

When the transcript text changes and the overlay needs to grow or shrink, it should animate smoothly — not jump abruptly!

One line adds animation to the overlay's size changes. Small but noticeable improvement!

## The Changes

Adds overlay resize animation to `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (1 line).
