## The Translation

The name "Warelay" was capitalized somewhere but should be lowercase "warelay." Consistency matters!

It's like making sure you spell someone's name the same way everywhere. Bob doesn't want to be called "BOB" in one place and "bob" in another.

Just a tiny fix, but it keeps things professional and consistent.

## The Changes

Fixes casing inconsistency, changing "Warelay" to lowercase "warelay" where appropriate in the documentation.
