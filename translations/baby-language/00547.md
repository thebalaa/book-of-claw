## The Translation

Have you ever used a notebook with tabs on the side? The tabs stay in place so you can always flip to a different section, even when you're looking at different pages.

The Settings window was having a problem: when you scrolled down in the settings, the tab bar (General, Voice Wake, Config, etc.) would scroll away too! You'd have to scroll all the way back up to switch tabs.

This fix makes the tabs "sticky" — they stay at the top while only the content below them scrolls. Now you can scroll through a long list of settings but still easily tap a different tab to switch sections.

Much better user experience!

## The Changes

Refactors `SettingsRootView.swift` (81 lines changed) to keep the tab bar fixed at the top while making only the content area scrollable. Uses proper SwiftUI layout to separate the fixed header from scrolling content.
