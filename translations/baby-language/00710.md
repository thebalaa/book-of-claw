## The Translation

When you're connected to a remote Clawdis server, the menu toggle should reflect that! Instead of just "Clawdis Active", it now says "Remote Clawdis Active".

4 lines make the context clearer.

## The Changes

Updates `MenuBar.swift` (5 lines) to show "Remote Clawdis Active" when in remote mode.
