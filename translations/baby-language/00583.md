title: "A Button to Restart the Relay"

## The Translation

Sometimes the relay (the messenger service) gets stuck or needs to be refreshed. Before, you had to quit and reopen the app or run special commands.

Now there's a "Restart Relay" button right in the Debug settings! Click it, and the relay stops and starts again. Quick and easy, like pressing a reset button.

Very handy for developers who are testing changes and need to restart frequently.

## The Changes

Adds a restart relay button to `DebugSettings.swift` (9 lines) that triggers a relay stop/start cycle.
