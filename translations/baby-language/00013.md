<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00013-821b7ae9b9-Add chalk styling and verbose command output-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added colors to the messages the program prints. Before, everything was the same color - like reading a book with no pictures. Now important messages have colors to help them stand out.

He used a toolbox called "chalk" (it's like colored markers for computer text). Now when the program talks to you:

- Success messages are green (like "Message delivered!")
- Warnings are yellow (like "heads up, something might be wrong")
- Information is cyan/blue (like helpful tips)
- Errors are red (like "oops, something broke")
- Verbose messages are gray (quieter, for background info)

It's like organizing your crayons by color. When you see green, you know everything is good. When you see red, you know to pay attention because something went wrong.

The program also added color helpers with friendly names: `success`, `warn`, `info`, and `danger`. These are like having labeled crayon boxes - grab the right color for the right kind of message.

## The Changes

This commit added the chalk library for colored console output:

- Added `chalk` dependency to package.json (version 5.6.2)
- Imported chalk in src/index.ts
- Created color helper constants: `success` (green), `warn` (yellow), `info` (cyan), `danger` (red)
- Made `logVerbose()` print in gray using `chalk.gray()`
- Colored success messages green in `sendMessage()` and `waitForFinalStatus()`
- Colored auto-reply confirmation green in the webhook handler
- Colored Tailscale funnel error messages: red for errors, cyan for informational URLs

This makes the CLI output much more scannable and user-friendly, with visual cues for different types of messages.
