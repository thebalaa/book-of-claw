title: "A Rule: No Real Data in Examples"

## The Translation

To prevent this problem from happening again, add a rule! Now AGENTS.md explicitly says: "Don't use real data in examples."

One line, but it sets a clear expectation for anyone contributing to the project.

## The Changes

Adds "no real data" rule to `AGENTS.md` (1 line) to prevent accidental inclusion of personal information in docs and code.
