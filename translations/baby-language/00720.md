## The Translation

Big architectural change! Instead of the Mac app running its own web chat server, the relay now handles it. The Mac app just creates a "tunnel" to the relay's web chat.

- New `webchat/server.ts` (218 lines!) — the relay-side server
- Simplified Mac app code (437 → 120 lines!)
- CLI gets webchat commands

373 lines added, 317 removed. A major simplification!

## The Changes

Moves webchat serving to relay loopback with `server.ts` (218 lines). Simplifies `WebChatWindow.swift` (317 lines removed). Updates CLI and Telegram files.
