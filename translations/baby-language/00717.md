## The Translation

To show chat history in remote mode, we need to fetch sessions from the remote server. The CLI can do this!

100 lines added, 24 removed:
- Fetch sessions using the CLI
- Log when history is missing
- Better error handling

The web chat now properly talks to remote Clawdis instances!

## The Changes

Updates `WebChatWindow.swift` (124 lines changed) to fetch remote sessions via CLI and log missing history.
