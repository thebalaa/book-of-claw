## The Translation

The control channel needs testing! Plus it should send initial "seed" events when clients connect.

112 new lines:
- `control-channel.test.ts` (95 lines!) — comprehensive tests
- Seed events on connect (11 lines)
- Updated remote docs (8 lines)

Test coverage for the new API!

## The Changes
