<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00011-0c5f3f37b4-Verbose mode now logs commands- prompts default to yes-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the program more talkative when you want it to be. Before, when the program needed to run commands (like asking another program to help), it would just do it silently. You wouldn't see what was happening behind the scenes.

Now, when you turn on verbose mode (by adding `--verbose`), the program becomes a chatterbox. It says "Look! I'm running this command!" and shows you exactly what it's doing. Like when you watch someone cook and they say each step out loud: "Now I'm cracking the eggs. Now I'm stirring the batter."

Peter added a special helper called `logVerbose()`. This is like a microphone that only turns on when verbose mode is on. The program can talk into it all the time, but you only hear it when you flip the switch.

When the program installs things like Go or tailscaled, it now whispers "Installing Go via Homebrew..." - but again, you only hear the whisper if you have verbose mode turned on.

## The Changes

This commit added verbose logging for system commands:

- Created `globalVerbose` variable and `setVerbose()` function to track verbose state
- Created `logVerbose()` helper function that only logs when verbose mode is enabled
- Modified `runExec()` to log the full command being executed when verbose is on (shows `$ command args`)
- Added verbose logging messages to `ensureGoInstalled()` and `ensureTailscaledInstalled()`
- Added verbose logging to `ensureFunnel()` when enabling the funnel
- Connected the `--verbose` flag to `setVerbose()` in both `webhook` and `setup` commands

The result: when verbose mode is enabled, users can see exactly what system commands are being run, making debugging and understanding much easier.
