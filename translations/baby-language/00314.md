## The Translation

The code formatter (Biome) wanted some things to look different. This change fixes the formatting so everything is neat and tidy.

It also adds the package-lock.json file which lists all the exact versions of tools and libraries being used. This helps make sure everyone has the same setup.

## The Changes

Applies Biome formatting fixes across several files and adds the package-lock.json for dependency version tracking.
