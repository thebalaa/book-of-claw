## The Translation

Sometimes the best way to explain something is to show it! This change adds a screenshot to the documentation.

It shows what Clawd looks like inside WhatsApp—a real conversation with the AI assistant. People can see exactly what they're building toward.

The image file is called "whatsapp-clawd.jpg" and it's linked in the docs. Seeing is believing!

## The Changes

Adds a WhatsApp screenshot image showing Clawd in action, with documentation linking to demonstrate the end-user experience.
