## The Translation

Remember how apps can be signed with either a "temporary" signature (ad-hoc) or your official developer signature? The docs didn't explain how to use your official one!

If you're an Apple Developer and want to sign the app with your real identity (so it works better and looks more official), you need to set an environment variable:

```
SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name" scripts/codesign-mac-app.sh
```

This commit adds that information to both the README and the signing documentation. Now developers know they have a choice and how to use it!

## The Changes

Documents the `SIGN_IDENTITY` environment variable in README.md and `docs/mac/signing.md`. Explains how to override ad-hoc signing with a proper Developer ID certificate for distribution builds.
