## The Translation

Oops! The CLI program was trying to use a function but forgot to import it—like trying to use a tool without taking it out of the toolbox first.

This tiny one-line fix adds the missing import. Now when the heartbeat command tries to resolve recipients, it actually has the function it needs.

Small bug, small fix. The tests probably caught this one!

## The Changes

Fixes a missing import in the CLI program for the recipients resolution function used by heartbeat commands.
