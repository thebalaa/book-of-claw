title: "Heartbeats That Don't Wake Sleeping Sessions"

## The Translation

Here's a tricky situation: sessions expire after being idle for too long. But heartbeats run periodically even when no one's talking. Should a heartbeat reset the "idle timer" for sessions?

Sometimes you want it to, sometimes you don't! Now there's a setting called "idle override" that lets you choose.

Also, this change makes sure that when a heartbeat runs, it doesn't accidentally make sessions look "fresh" when they're really stale. It preserves the original timestamp—like not changing the "last modified" date on a file when you just peek at it.

## The Changes

Adds a `heartbeatIdleOverride` configuration option to control whether heartbeats reset session idle timers. Also ensures heartbeat processing preserves session freshness timestamps, preventing heartbeat activity from artificially extending session lifetimes.
