## The Translation

HUGE feature: a proper WebSocket Gateway for control communication!

Major additions:
- `GatewayChannel.swift` (221 lines) — WS client
- `Protocol.swift` (895 lines!) — typed protocol
- Architecture docs (82 + 126 + 167 lines)
- AgentRPC refactored (396 lines changed)

The gateway provides real-time, typed communication!

## The Changes

Finalizes WS control plane with GatewayChannel, Protocol, and extensive documentation across 10+ files.
