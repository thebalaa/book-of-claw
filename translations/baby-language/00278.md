## The Translation

The heartbeat notes in the changelog get moved to a new section: "unreleased 1.2.2." 

This keeps things organized—features that aren't released yet go in the unreleased section. When it's time to release, that section becomes the release notes.

It's like keeping your homework for different classes in different folders!

## The Changes

Moves heartbeat feature notes to the unreleased 1.2.2 section in the changelog to prepare for the next release.
