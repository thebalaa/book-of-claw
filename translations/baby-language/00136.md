## The Translation

You know how stores flip a sign to "OPEN" when they're ready for customers? It tells everyone "Hey, we're here and ready to help!"

The web relay (our messenger) was starting up but not telling anyone it was available. It was like opening a store but keeping the lights off and the sign on "CLOSED."

Now, as soon as the relay starts up, it announces: "I'm available!" This "presence" signal lets other systems know that we're online and ready to receive messages. Welcome, we're open!

## The Changes

Adds presence announcement when the web relay starts. Sets "available" status on connection so the account appears online to contacts.
