title: "Making the Heartbeat Prompt Shorter"

## The Translation

The heartbeat sends a little message when it runs. But that message was longer than it needed to be!

This change shortens it down to just a "token"—the smallest meaningful piece. It's like changing "Please check in now and tell me how you're doing" to just "Heartbeat."

Less words means less work for everyone. Get to the point!

## The Changes

Shortens the heartbeat prompt to a minimal token, reducing the message size sent during heartbeat triggers.
