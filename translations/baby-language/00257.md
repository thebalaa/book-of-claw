## The Translation

When setting up the AI assistant, there are other tools that can help! This change adds links to "Peekaboo" and "mcporter"—two helpful tools the community recommends.

It's like a book suggesting "you might also enjoy these other books." The more good tools you know about, the better your setup can be!

## The Changes

Adds links to Peekaboo and mcporter tools in the Claude configuration documentation's recommended tools section.
