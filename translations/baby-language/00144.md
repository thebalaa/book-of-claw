## The Translation

You know how stores put "NEW!" signs on products? But after a while, that product isn't new anymore, and the sign looks silly.

The images section in our README had "(new)" next to it, like a little sticker saying "look, this feature is fresh!" But now that images have been around for a bit, that sticker was outdated.

One tiny change: we peeled off the "(new)" sticker. The feature is just a normal part of the project now. No need to keep shouting about how new it is!

## The Changes

Removes the "(new)" label from the images section header in README. The feature is now established and doesn't need the "new" callout.
