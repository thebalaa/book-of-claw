## The Translation

Imagine you're giving someone directions, but you keep saying "go that way" without pointing. Confusing, right?

The helper robots knew Node was installed by setup-node, but during the install step, they couldn't find it! The PATH (the list of places to look for tools) wasn't pointing to the right spot.

We added four more lines that say "Look HERE first!" — forcefully putting the setup-node tools at the front of the PATH. Now the robots can't miss it. Clear directions make everything easier!

## The Changes

Adds PATH manipulation to CI workflow to ensure setup-node's bin directory is searched first during pnpm install. Fixes tool discovery issues.
