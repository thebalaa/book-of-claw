title: "Don't Crash if Speech Recognition Isn't Available"

## The Translation

Not every Mac has speech recognition available. Maybe it's an older Mac, or maybe the feature is disabled. Trying to use something that doesn't exist = crash!

This fix adds a guard:
- Check if speech recognition is available
- If not, gracefully skip it instead of crashing
- Log a helpful message explaining why

7 lines that prevent a crash. Defensive programming!

## The Changes

Adds 6 lines to `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` guarding against unavailable speech recognizer. Prevents crash on unsupported systems.
