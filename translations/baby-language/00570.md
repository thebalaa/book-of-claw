## The Translation

When programs want to talk to each other through XPC, they need to prove they're trustworthy. Like showing your student ID to get into school.

This change allows two types of clients to connect:
1. **Signed CLI** — The command-line tool that's properly signed with Apple's security
2. **Same-UID** — Programs running as the same user (like you running two things yourself)

This makes the security more flexible while still being safe. The CLI can now talk to the main app, and programs you run yourself are trusted.

## The Changes

Updates XPC client authentication in `MenuBar.swift` (35 lines changed) to accept signed CLI connections and same-user-ID clients. Adds 2 lines to CLI for proper identification.
