## The Translation

There are fancy ways to get things and simple ways. Sometimes the fancy way breaks, and you just need to do it the easy way.

We were using a special "action" to install pnpm (a helper tool), but it kept causing problems. Actions are like hiring someone else to do a task — sometimes they don't show up or do it wrong.

So we switched to the simple approach: just run `npm install pnpm`. It's like instead of ordering a pizza for delivery, you just walk to the pizza place yourself. More direct, more reliable.

## The Changes

Replaces the pnpm/action-setup GitHub Action with a simple `npm install -g pnpm` command. Reduces complexity and avoids issues with the action's setup process.
