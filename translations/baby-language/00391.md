## The Translation

With the rebrand to CLAWDIS, the config file can now be named `clawdis.json`! The old name still works for compatibility.

It's like getting a new name tag that matches your new identity.

## The Changes

Adds support for clawdis.json as a configuration file path alongside the legacy path for the rebrand.
