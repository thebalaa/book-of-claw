## The Translation

Remember how we gave up on the automatic Node installer and did everything by hand? Well, turns out the automatic way started working again!

It's like when the dishwasher repairman comes and fixes it. Sure, you CAN wash dishes by hand, but why would you when the machine works?

We removed 17 lines of manual "do it yourself" instructions and went back to using setup-node and the pnpm action. They know what they're doing, and now they're working properly. Back to easy mode!

## The Changes

Returns to using setup-node with Node 22.9.0 and the official pnpm action. Removes the manual Node installation workaround that was added earlier, reducing CI complexity.
