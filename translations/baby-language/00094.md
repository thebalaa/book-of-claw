<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00094-3aedef4126-feat- log auto-reply body and stats for web provider-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added logging of auto-reply message content and statistics for the web provider. Now you can see what auto-replies were sent, how long they took, and other useful stats.

This helps with debugging and monitoring - you know exactly what the bot is saying to people.

## The Changes

- Added auto-reply body logging for web provider
- Added timing and stats logging
- Helpful for monitoring bot behavior
- Consistent with Twilio provider logging

Web provider now logs auto-reply details like Twilio provider does.
