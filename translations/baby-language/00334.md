## The Translation

The heartbeat command is optional—you don't have to use it. But the code wasn't checking carefully whether it existed before trying to use it!

This change adds "guards"—checks that say "Is this thing here? No? Okay, skip it." Now the code won't crash if you haven't set up a heartbeat command.

Defensive coding prevents surprises!

## The Changes

Adds guards to check for the optional heartbeatCommand configuration before attempting to use it, preventing crashes when heartbeat is not configured.
