<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00086-d1923e6efe-feat- add send -json- logger cleanup- and resilient Claude parsing-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a `--json` flag to the send command for sending structured data. He also made Claude JSON parsing even more resilient - it can now handle various JSON formats and edge cases.

The logger got more cleanup too.

## The Changes

- Added --json flag for send command
- Improved Claude JSON parsing robustness
- Continued logger cleanup
- Better handling of JSON edge cases

Send command now supports JSON payloads and parsing is more reliable.
