## The Translation

You can @mention someone in the caption of a picture. But the system wasn't catching those mentions!

Now it does. If you send a photo with caption "@Clawd what's this?", the AI will see it's being mentioned and respond.

## The Changes

Fixes mention detection to capture @mentions from media captions, not just message bodies.
