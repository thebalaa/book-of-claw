## The Translation

Here we go again — another small README tweak! One line changed. Could be a typo fix, could be a wording improvement, could be updating a link.

It might seem silly to track such tiny changes, but that's the beauty of version control. Every change, no matter how small, is recorded. If something breaks, we can see exactly what changed and when.

Think of it like keeping receipts. You might not need them often, but when you do, you're glad you have them!

## The Changes

Minor README update with a single line change. Part of ongoing documentation maintenance.
