## The Translation

There are "thinking helpers"—code that helps manage how much the AI should think about a problem. This code was scattered around.

This change aligns and organizes those helpers. They get moved to the right place and formatted consistently.

Organized code is easier to understand and maintain!

## The Changes

Reorganizes and aligns thinking helper code, moving related functionality to the appropriate modules and improving code structure.
