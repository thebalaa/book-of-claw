## The Translation

Remember that cool `clawlog.sh` tool for reading logs? Well, if nobody knows about it, nobody will use it!

This one-line addition to AGENTS.md (the developer manual) mentions the clawlog helper. Now when developers are looking through the instructions, they'll see "Oh hey, there's a log viewing tool!" and know to use it.

Documentation is only useful if people can find it!

## The Changes

Adds a one-line note to `AGENTS.md` mentioning the `clawlog.sh` helper script for debugging.
