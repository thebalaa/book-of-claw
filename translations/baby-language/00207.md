## The Translation

Yesterday we cleaned up some of the code. Today we're cleaning up even more!

It's like when you clean your room—first you make your bed, then you realize the floor needs vacuuming, then you notice the closet is a mess too. One cleanup leads to another.

This change runs a special tool called a "linter" (which is like a very picky teacher) that checks if everything follows the rules. Then it fixes anything that doesn't look quite right. Same spaces, same style, same way of writing things everywhere.

Again, the code still does exactly what it did before. We're just making sure it all looks like it was written by one neat, organized person.

## The Changes

Applies formatting and linting across multiple source files. The linter enforces consistent code style rules, fixing minor formatting inconsistencies to maintain a uniform codebase.
