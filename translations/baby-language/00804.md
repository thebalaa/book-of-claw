title: "More Robust Connection Handling"

## The Translation

The control channel's connection "continuation" (a Swift concurrency concept) could get into weird states. This hardens it!

13 lines make the connection handling more robust. No more hanging or double-resumption errors.

## The Changes

Hardens control channel connection continuation in `ControlChannel.swift` (16 lines changed, 13 added).
