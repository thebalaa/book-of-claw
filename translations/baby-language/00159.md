## The Translation

When you're showing someone how to fill out a form, you don't write your REAL phone number as an example, right? You write something fake like "555-1234."

The README had an example Twilio phone number that looked kinda real. It might confuse people into thinking they should use THAT number, or worse, someone might accidentally use it!

We swapped it out for a clearly fake placeholder number. Now it's obvious: "This is just an example, put YOUR number here!" Much clearer, and no accidental calls to random strangers.

## The Changes

Replaces the example Twilio phone number in README with a randomized placeholder that's clearly not a real number.
