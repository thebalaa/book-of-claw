title: "Adding WebSocket Types"

## The Translation

The WebSocket code needs type definitions for TypeScript. Adding the `ws` types package and cleaning up the server build.

Quick addition so TypeScript understands WebSocket types!

## The Changes

Adds ws types to package.json (1 line) and cleans up server imports (3 lines changed).
