## The Translation

Sometimes rules are too strict. Like if you said "I'll ONLY eat ice cream if it's exactly 32 degrees" — you'd miss out on a lot of ice cream!

Our helper robots had two strict rules:
1. They checked if the Node version matched EXACTLY what was requested
2. They used a "frozen lockfile" that couldn't be updated

We relaxed these rules a bit. The engine check is looser now (close enough is good enough), and the lockfile can be updated if needed. Sometimes being a bit flexible helps everything run smoother.

## The Changes

Relaxes the engine version check in CI and removes the frozen-lockfile requirement from pnpm install. Allows more flexibility in dependency management.
