## The Translation

The health command exists in the CLI, but what about seeing health status in the Mac app? Now you can!

This big commit:
- Adds a `HealthStore.swift` (149 lines) to track health status
- Shows health in General Settings (72 lines)
- Adds health info to the menu bar (16 lines)

Like having a health dashboard right in your app. Green checkmarks when healthy, warnings when something needs attention!

## The Changes

Adds comprehensive health UI with `HealthStore.swift` (149 lines), GeneralSettings display (72 lines), and MenuBar integration (16 lines). Updates docs and related test files.
