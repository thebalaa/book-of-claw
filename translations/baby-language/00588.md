## The Translation

The silent treatment isn't helpful when debugging! When SSH or CLI commands failed, the system was staying quiet about it.

This fix adds proper logging:
- If SSH fails, log why
- If CLI execution fails, log the error
- Don't just silently swallow problems

Now when something goes wrong with voice forwarding, you'll see it in the logs instead of wondering why nothing happened.

## The Changes

Adds 4 lines of error logging to `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` for SSH and CLI failures instead of silent failure.
