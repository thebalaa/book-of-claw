<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00040-47663c38fe-Simplify command log to show resolved argv only-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter simplified the command logging to be cleaner and less noisy. Instead of logging multiple times (before template, after template, during execution), it now just logs once with the final resolved command.

The log message changed from multiple verbose entries to one clear line showing exactly what command is being executed with all templates filled in.

It's like cleaning up a messy note-taking system - instead of scratch paper everywhere, you just write the final clean version once.

## The Changes

This commit simplified command logging:

- Removed redundant logging steps
- Consolidated to single log entry showing final resolved command
- Reduced verbosity while maintaining essential debugging information

Command execution logs are now cleaner and easier to read.
