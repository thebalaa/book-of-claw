## The Translation

Some AI agents don't just return one piece of text—they return multiple pieces! Maybe they're giving a list of options, or breaking up their response.

Now the auto-reply system can handle these multi-text outputs from RPC (Remote Procedure Call) agents. Instead of crashing or ignoring extra parts, it processes them all.

More flexibility = more capability!

## The Changes

Adds support for multi-text RPC outputs from AI agents, allowing the auto-reply system to handle agents that return multiple text segments.
