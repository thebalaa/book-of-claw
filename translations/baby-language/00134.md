## The Translation

You know those blue checkmarks in WhatsApp that show someone read your message? They're called "read receipts" — little signals that say "I saw that!"

Before, when someone sent us a message on the web, we'd process it but never send back those little "I got it" checkmarks. It was like reading someone's note and not looking up at them!

Now we properly send read receipts. When a message comes in, we tell WhatsApp "Yep, received and read!" It's basic politeness, really — acknowledging that someone spoke to you.

## The Changes

Adds read receipt functionality to the web provider. When inbound messages are received via Baileys, the system now sends read receipts back to the sender.
