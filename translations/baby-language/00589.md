title: "Sending Agent Messages Through the System"

## The Translation

The agent (AI assistant) needs a way to send messages. This sets up the communication pipeline:

1. **CLI gets an "agent send" command** — You can type `clawdis agent send "Hello!"`
2. **XPC wiring** — The CLI talks to the main app through XPC
3. **IPC protocol** — The message format is defined

It's like setting up a postal system: the mailbox (CLI), the mail truck (XPC), and the post office protocol (IPC). Now the agent can send messages through proper channels!

## The Changes

Adds agent send command to CLI (23 lines), XPC handling (16 lines), and IPC protocol definition (15 lines). Total 54 new lines wiring up the agent send pipeline.
