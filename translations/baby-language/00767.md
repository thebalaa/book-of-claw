## The Translation

When the webchat fails to load, users need to know WHY. This adds:
- Preflight reachability checks (can we reach the server?)
- Better error surface (show what went wrong)
- Clearer failure messages

53 lines make debugging webchat issues much easier!

## The Changes

Adds preflight reachability and improved error display to `WebChatWindow.swift` (61 lines changed, 53 added).
