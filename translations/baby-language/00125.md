## The Translation

Imagine you're reading a message that says: "Look at this picture: MEDIA:/photos/cat.jpg, isn't it cute?"

The old code would see that comma stuck to the picture address and get confused. It might try to find a file called "cat.jpg," (with the comma) which doesn't exist!

Now we're smarter. We keep the punctuation from messing up our picture addresses. The comma stays as part of the sentence, not part of the filename.

We also added a diary for when pictures from the web don't work. Now when something fails, we write down what went wrong so we can fix it later.

## The Changes

Fixes MEDIA token parsing to handle trailing punctuation correctly. Adds logging for web media failures to help debug issues when remote images can't be fetched.
