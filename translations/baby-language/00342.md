## The Translation

When you turn on verbose mode, the system remembers it for your session. You don't have to say "/verbose" every single time!

This "session hint" persists your preference. The code got reorganized to handle this better, with tests making sure it actually works.

Set it once, see everything, until you turn it off.

## The Changes

Adds session-persistent verbose hint so the verbose mode setting carries across messages within a session.
