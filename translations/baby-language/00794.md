## The Translation

The send chime code was scattered across different files. Let's centralize it!

40 lines added, 19 removed:
- Chime logic in one place
- Guard against playing when not appropriate
- Cleaner code organization

## The Changes

Centralizes send chime logic in Utilities (26 lines), VoiceWakeChime (5 lines), and updates callers (4 files total).
