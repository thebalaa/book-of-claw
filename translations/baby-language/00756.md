## The Translation

When the agent thinks deeply (extended thinking), the webchat should show that! Now the thinking level syncs between the session and the web interface.

168 lines added, 136 removed across 8 files:
- Chat panel updates
- Agent interface improvements
- Bootstrap changes
- New documentation

The webchat now properly reflects the AI's thinking mode!

## The Changes

Syncs thinking level between session and webchat across ChatPanel, AgentInterface, bootstrap, bundle, docs, and server (8 files).
