## The Translation

The project's automated tests (CI) run on Mac machines in the cloud. They were using an older macOS version, but the code needs newer features (Xcode 26.1).

This updates the CI configuration to use `macos-latest` with Xcode 26.1. Now the automated tests run on modern macOS and can test all the new features!

## The Changes

Updates `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (6 lines) to use macos-latest with Xcode 26.1 for CI builds.
