## The Translation

Where should the health row go in the UI? Right under the remote picker makes sense — it shows the health of your connection.

Also improves the timeout message to be clearer. 7 lines added, 1 removed.

## The Changes

Places health row under remote picker in `GeneralSettings.swift` (4 lines) and improves timeout messaging in `HealthStore.swift` (4 lines).
