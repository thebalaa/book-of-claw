## The Translation

During onboarding, the CLI helper gets installed. But is it installed? Users couldn't tell!

Now the onboarding screen shows the helper install status:
- "Not installed"
- "Installing..."
- "Installed ✓"

26 new lines provide this helpful feedback!

## The Changes

Adds helper installation status display to `Onboarding.swift` (34 lines changed, 26 added, 8 removed).
