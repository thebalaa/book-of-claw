## The Translation

The MenuBar.swift file was HUGE — 613 lines! Too big to navigate easily. Time to split it up.

New focused files:
- `CritterStatusLabel.swift` (325 lines) — the critter icon
- `MenuContentView.swift` (272 lines) — the menu content

597 lines added to new files, 613 removed from MenuBar. Much more organized!

## The Changes

Splits MenuBar UI into `CritterStatusLabel.swift` (325 lines) and `MenuContentView.swift` (272 lines).
