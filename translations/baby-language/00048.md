<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00048-cafca5c421-Refactor CLI into modules for web provider and utils-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter broke the giant index.ts file (which had everything in one file) into smaller, organized modules. Now there's a web provider module, a utils module, and the main CLI module.

It's like cleaning your room by putting clothes in the closet, books on the shelf, and toys in bins - instead of everything piled on the floor. Same stuff, better organization.

This makes the code easier to find, test, and modify. When you want to change how the web provider works, you just open that one file instead of searching through thousands of lines.

## The Changes

This commit refactored monolithic code into modules:

- Created src/provider-web.ts for WhatsApp Web logic
- Created src/utils.ts for shared utilities
- Moved provider-specific code out of index.ts
- Updated imports and exports
- Tests updated to match new module structure

The codebase is now modular and easier to navigate.
