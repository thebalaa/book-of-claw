## The Translation

In the embedded web chat (inside the Mac app), users don't need to pick their AI model — it's preconfigured. Showing the model selector would just be confusing!

This hides the model selector when running in embedded mode. The UI is cleaner and simpler for this use case.

469 lines in the bundle change because the whole thing gets rebuilt when you change one thing!

## The Changes

Hides model selector in embedded UI mode across `ChatPanel.js`, `bootstrap.js`, and the bundle (469 lines of bundle changes).
