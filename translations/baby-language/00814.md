title: "Removing the Level Meter Bar"

## The Translation

The level meter was adding visual clutter without enough value. Simplify — remove it!

16 lines added, 32 removed. The overlay is cleaner without the bar meter.

## The Changes

Removes overlay bar meter in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (48 lines changed, net -16 lines).
