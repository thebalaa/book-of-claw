## The Translation

Pi (one of the AI agents) uses something called "tau rpc" to communicate. Before, every message created a new connection. That's slow!

Now the connection is reused. It's like keeping the phone line open instead of hanging up and redialing for every sentence.

Also, there's a new agent: Gemini! More AI options for everyone.

## The Changes

Improves Pi agent performance by reusing tau rpc connections for command auto-replies instead of creating new connections each time. Also adds Gemini as a new agent option.
