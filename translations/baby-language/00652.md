title: "A Clean PATH for SSH"

## The Translation

Environment variables from your shell can be messy — extra paths, weird settings, stuff you've forgotten about. When SSH runs a remote command, that junk can cause problems!

This fix uses a clean PATH for SSH commands. Only the essential directories, no inherited clutter. More predictable, more reliable!

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (3 lines) to use a clean PATH environment for SSH commands instead of inheriting junk.
