<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00014-1e00bff96a-Silence dotenv tip output -quiet mode-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter told dotenv (the helper that loads saved settings) to be quiet.

Dotenv is like a librarian who reads your saved settings from a special notebook (the .env file). But before, this librarian would sometimes give you tips and advice you didn't ask for - like "Hey, did you know you can do this?" or "Here's a suggestion!"

Now Peter added `{ quiet: true }` which is like putting up a "Please be quiet" sign. The librarian still does their job perfectly - they still read all your settings and hand them to the program - but they don't give unsolicited advice anymore.

It's a tiny change (just adding two words: `quiet: true`) but it makes the program's output cleaner and less chatty.

## The Changes

This commit silenced dotenv's informational output:

- Changed `dotenv.config()` to `dotenv.config({ quiet: true })`

This prevents dotenv from printing tips or warnings about the .env file (like "no .env file found" messages), while still loading environment variables normally. It reduces noise in the console output.
