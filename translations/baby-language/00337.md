title: "Teaching the AI to Think Harder"

## The Translation

Sometimes you want the AI to think quickly. Other times, you want it to think really deeply—like when solving a hard puzzle.

"Thinking directives" let you control this! You can say "think harder about this one" and the AI will spend more time reasoning before answering.

The directives can be set in your config or even requested per-message. More thinking often means better answers for complex questions!

## The Changes

Adds thinking directives feature allowing configuration of AI reasoning levels. Includes session-based thinking settings and extensive tests covering different thinking scenarios.
