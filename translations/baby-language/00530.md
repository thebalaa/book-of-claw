title: "A Helper Script for Signing Your App"

## The Translation

When you make something special, you might put your signature on it to prove it's really yours. Mac apps work the same way — they need to be "signed" so your computer knows they're trustworthy.

Before, the signing happened as part of the build process. But what if you just want to sign an app that's already built? Or sign it with a different signature?

This commit adds a helper script called `codesign-mac-app.sh`. It's like a separate signing station:
- It can sign just the app without rebuilding everything
- It can use your personal developer signature (if you set `SIGN_IDENTITY`)
- It handles all the tricky parts automatically

The docs got updated too, explaining when to use each script and how the signing process works.

## The Changes

Adds `scripts/codesign-mac-app.sh` — a standalone code signing helper for the Mac app. Updates `scripts/package-mac-app.sh` to use the new helper. Expands `docs/mac/signing.md` with details about the ad-hoc vs. identity signing options.
