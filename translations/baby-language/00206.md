## The Translation

Have you ever seen someone's homework where some lines start way over here and others start way over there? It looks messy and confusing!

Code is like homework for computers, and it looks much nicer when everything lines up the same way. This change goes through the code and makes all the indents (those little spaces at the start of lines) exactly the same—two spaces each.

Nothing about what the code *does* changed. It still does all the same tricks. But now when people read it, their eyes don't have to jump around. Everything is neat and tidy, like organizing your bookshelf so all the books face the same direction.

It's spring cleaning for code!

## The Changes

Normalizes indentation throughout the configuration and test files to use consistent 2-space indents. This is a formatting-only change with no functional impact—the code behaves exactly the same, just looks more uniform.
