<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00097-435ca06f16-docs- fix markdown escaping in README-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter fixed markdown escaping issues in the README. Special characters like underscores and brackets weren't displaying correctly - now they're properly escaped so the formatting works.

It's like fixing typos in a published document - small fixes for better readability.

## The Changes

- Fixed markdown escaping in README
- Corrected special character handling
- Improved formatting display

README now renders correctly without formatting glitches.
