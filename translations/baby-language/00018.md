<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00018-e52e943317-Add TWILIO_SENDER_SID override and better funnel-setup error messages-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a shortcut for people who already know their Twilio sender ID. Normally, the program has to search through your Twilio account to find the right WhatsApp sender (like looking through a phonebook). But if you already know the exact ID, you can just tell the program directly.

It's the new `TWILIO_SENDER_SID` setting in your .env file (that's the notebook where you save your settings). If you fill it in, the program skips the search and uses what you gave it. If you leave it blank, the program searches like before.

Peter also made error messages much better:

When the sender search fails, instead of just crashing, the program now says in red "Unable to list WhatsApp senders" and in blue it tells you "Put TWILIO_SENDER_SID in your .env file to skip this step - you can find it in the Twilio Console."

Same thing when updating the webhook URL fails. Now it gives you a helpful message instead of mysterious errors.

## The Changes

This commit added TWILIO_SENDER_SID override and improved error messages:

- Added `whatsappSenderSid` optional property to `EnvConfig` type
- Added reading `TWILIO_SENDER_SID` from environment variables in `readEnv()`
- Wrapped `findWhatsappSenderSid()` in try-catch with helpful error messages suggesting TWILIO_SENDER_SID
- Improved error message when senders list is empty
- Added .catch() handler to `updateWebhook()` with colored error messages
- Changed webhook success message to use green `success()` color
- Updated README to document the optional TWILIO_SENDER_SID environment variable

This gives advanced users a way to skip sender discovery and provides much clearer guidance when API calls fail.
