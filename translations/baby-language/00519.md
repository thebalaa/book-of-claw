## The Translation

Imagine you're trying to follow a recipe, but you're standing in the wrong kitchen. You keep looking for ingredients that aren't there because you're in the wrong place!

The pnpm tool (which helps run JavaScript projects) had this problem. It was being asked to run `clawdis relay`, but it wasn't standing in the right folder — the one with the `package.json` file (like the recipe book that tells it what ingredients exist).

This fix tells pnpm exactly where to stand: "Go to the project root folder first, then run the command." It adds `--dir` with the project path.

It also sets up some helpful environment variables, like `PNPM_HOME` (where pnpm stores its stuff) and `CLAWDIS_PROJECT_ROOT` (so other programs know where the project lives). It's like putting up signs so everyone knows where things are!

## The Changes

Passes `--dir` flag to pnpm with the project root path so it can find `package.json`. Adds `PNPM_HOME` and `CLAWDIS_PROJECT_ROOT` environment variables to the relay process environment for proper path resolution.
