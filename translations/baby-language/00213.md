## The Translation

You know how when you log into something, you usually need a way to log out too? Like how a library card lets you check out books, but you should also be able to return them!

Before this change, once you connected to WhatsApp Web, there wasn't a clean way to disconnect. The system just stayed logged in forever.

Now there's a "logout" command! It politely tells WhatsApp "I'm done now, please forget me." This clears the saved session information so next time, you'd need to scan the QR code again.

The tests make sure this logout actually works—checking that after you say goodbye, you really are logged out and not just pretending.

## The Changes

Adds a `logout` CLI command for the web provider that terminates the WhatsApp Web session and clears stored session data. Includes corresponding tests to verify the logout functionality properly clears session state.
