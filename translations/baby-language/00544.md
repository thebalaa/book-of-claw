title: "Moving the Status Light Closer to the Switch"

## The Translation

When you flip a light switch, you want to see right away if the light turned on. The feedback should be right next to the thing you just pressed!

The relay status indicator (that little colored dot showing if the relay is running) was placed a bit far from the "Clawdis Active" toggle switch. This tiny one-line change moves it directly under the toggle.

Now when you turn Clawdis on or off, you immediately see the relay status change right there. The information is where you expect it, making the menu feel more intuitive.

## The Changes

Moves the relay status row in `MenuBar.swift` to appear directly under the "Clawdis Active" toggle instead of lower in the menu. A one-line reordering for better UX.
