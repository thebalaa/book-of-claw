## The Translation

The web chat server was working, but when things went wrong, there wasn't much logging. Hard to debug!

This adds 33 lines of logging:
- When the server starts
- When requests come in
- When files are served

Plus 19 lines of cleanup to make sure it all compiles properly.

## The Changes

Adds server logging and build fixes to `WebChatServer.swift` (52 lines changed, 33 added, 19 removed).
