title: "Showing Alerts When Logs Are Missing"

## The Translation

The health panel can show log files, but what if the log file doesn't exist? Before, it would just... do nothing. Confusing!

Now it shows an alert: "Log file not found." Clear feedback helps users understand what's happening.

## The Changes

Adds 3 lines to `GeneralSettings.swift` to display an alert when log files are missing and aligns action buttons.
