## The Translation

HeartbeatEventPayload was being exported at runtime, but it's only a TypeScript type! Types shouldn't exist at runtime.

2 lines remove the unnecessary runtime export. Cleaner code!

## The Changes

Removes runtime export of type-only HeartbeatEventPayload from `control-channel.ts` (2 lines deleted).
