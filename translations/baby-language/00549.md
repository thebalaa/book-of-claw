## The Translation

Some apps just run when you open them. But other apps are more like helpful assistants that are always ready — they start automatically and keep running in the background.

"launchd" is macOS's system for managing these background services. This commit updates the restart script to run Clawdis as a proper launchd agent. That means:

1. It can start automatically when you log in
2. It runs in the background even when you're not looking at it
3. It can communicate with other apps through a "Mach service" (a special macOS messaging system)

The restart script now knows how to:
- Install the launchd configuration
- Start/stop the service properly
- Set up the Mach service for communication

## The Changes

Updates `scripts/restart-mac.sh` (41 new lines) to manage Clawdis as a launchd agent. Adds Mach service registration for inter-process communication. Creates the proper plist configuration for automatic startup.
