title: "A Little Light That Shows If the Engine Is Running"

## The Translation

You know how cars have little lights on the dashboard? One might be green when the engine is running smoothly, or red if something's wrong. These lights help you know what's happening inside without having to open the hood!

Clawdis now has something like that. In the menu bar (that little icon at the top of your screen), there's now a tiny colored dot that tells you what the "relay" is doing. The relay is like a messenger that helps Clawdis talk to other programs.

- **Green dot**: Everything's great! The messenger is running.
- **Orange dot**: Hold on, it's starting up or restarting.
- **Red dot**: Uh oh, something went wrong.
- **Gray dot**: The messenger is taking a nap (stopped).

Now you can glance at the menu and know exactly what's happening without digging through settings!

## The Changes

Adds a relay status indicator to the macOS menu bar. Shows a colored circle (green=running, orange=starting/restarting, red=failed, gray=stopped) with a status label. Uses `RelayProcessManager.shared` to observe the current relay state in real-time.
