## The Translation

The Voice Wake settings file was getting HUGE — hard to navigate and maintain. Time to split it up!

Each piece now has its own file:
- `MicLevelMonitor.swift` (81 lines) — audio level display
- `VoiceWakeForwardSection.swift` (108 lines) — SSH forwarding settings
- `VoiceWakeTestCard.swift` (89 lines) — the test button card
- `VoiceWakeTester.swift` (229 lines) — testing logic

575 lines added across new files, 535 removed from the main settings file. Much more organized!

## The Changes

Splits `VoiceWakeSettings.swift` into 4 focused modules. Original file goes from 600+ lines to ~68 lines. Better organization!
