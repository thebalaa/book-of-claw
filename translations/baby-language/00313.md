## The Translation

The Claude identity prefix (the "Hi, I'm Claude..." introduction) should appear on the first message of a session. Something was preventing that!

This tiny one-line fix removes the blocker. Now the identity prefix shows up correctly at the beginning of conversations.

Sometimes the smallest fixes have the biggest impact!

## The Changes

Removes a line that was incorrectly preventing the Claude identity prefix from being sent on the first session message.
