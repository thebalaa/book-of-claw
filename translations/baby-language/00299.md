## The Translation

New feature? New tests! Each agent (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi) gets tested to make sure it works properly.

The tests check: "Can we send a message to this AI? Does it respond correctly? Do the error cases work?"

Some web defaults also got fixed along the way—little tweaks to make everything work better.

## The Changes

Adds comprehensive test coverage for all agent implementations and fixes web module default configurations. Tests verify correct behavior for Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi agents.
