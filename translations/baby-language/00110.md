<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00110-4d902708-ci: use available Node 22.21.1-/ -->

## The Translation

Remember commit 104, where Peter picked a specific version of Node (like picking an exact shoe size)?

Well, it turns out that exact size wasn't available at the shoe store (the CI runner didn't have Node 22.11.0). So Peter changed it to 22.21.1 — a version that IS available.

It's a tiny change: just one number in one line. But without it, the robot helper couldn't even start its work because it couldn't find the right tools.

Sometimes the smallest fixes are the most important. Can't build a house if you can't find your hammer!

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on November 25, 2025, changing the Node.js version from 22.11.0 to 22.21.1. The previous version wasn't available on the GitHub Actions runner. This is a one-line change to unblock CI.
