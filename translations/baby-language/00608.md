## The Translation

The health probe tests were okay, but they could be stronger. What if the probe returns weird data? What about edge cases?

These 14 new test lines check more scenarios:
- Empty responses
- Partial data
- Error conditions

Stronger tests = more reliable health checks!

## The Changes

Adds 14 lines to `health.test.ts` improving test coverage for edge cases and error conditions.
