## The Translation

Big change: the Twilio provider is being removed! The project is now web-only.

Twilio was one way to connect to WhatsApp, but the web approach works better for this project. Simplifying to one provider means less complexity.

Lots of code gets removed. Sometimes subtracting makes things better!

## The Changes

Removes Twilio provider support, making the project web-only for WhatsApp connectivity.
