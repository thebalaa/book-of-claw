title: "A Prefix for Same-Phone Replies"

## The Translation

When using same-phone mode, you might want replies to start with something special—like "🤖: " to show it's the AI talking, not you!

This change adds a config option for that. You can set whatever prefix you want, and all responses from the AI will start with it.

It helps tell the difference between "you typing" and "the AI typing" when both happen on the same phone.

## The Changes

Adds `samePhoneResponsePrefix` configuration option to prepend a custom prefix to AI responses when operating in same-phone mode.
