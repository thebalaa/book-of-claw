<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00072-afdaa7ef98-Refactor CLI and Twilio modules- add helper tests and comments-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter refactored the CLI command modules and added tests for Twilio helper functions. He also added helpful comments explaining what each module does.

More organization, more tests, better documentation - the codebase keeps getting cleaner and more maintainable.

## The Changes

This commit refactored CLI modules:

- Improved command module structure
- Added tests for Twilio utilities
- Added inline documentation comments
- Better separation of concerns

CLI commands are now better tested and documented.
