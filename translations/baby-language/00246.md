title: "Actually Using the Session Override"

## The Translation

Remember that session override feature? Turns out there was a small bug—the code wasn't quite respecting the override in all cases!

This fix makes sure that when you say "use this specific session," the code actually listens. No more ignoring the instructions!

The test gets a bit better too, making sure we're checking the right thing.

## The Changes

Fixes a bug where the session override wasn't being properly honored in all heartbeat scenarios. Updates the test to verify correct session override behavior.
