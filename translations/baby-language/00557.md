## The Translation

This commit makes the voice detection smarter in three ways:

1. **Log when it hears something** — Now you can see in the logs when it detects your wake word. Helpful for debugging!

2. **Wait for 1 second of silence** — Before processing, it waits until you've been quiet for a full second. This makes sure you've finished speaking.

3. **Clearer SSH logs** — When forwarding to another computer, the logs now explain what's happening more clearly.

Better logging = easier debugging. Better silence detection = more reliable wake word recognition.

## The Changes

Adds detection logging, 1-second silence holdoff, and improved SSH log messages. 67 new lines across PermissionManager (57), VoiceWakeForwarder (10), and VoiceWakeSettings (1).
