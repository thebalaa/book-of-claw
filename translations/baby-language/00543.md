## The Translation

Imagine if different parts of your homework had different dates on them. Your teacher would be confused! "Is this from Monday or Tuesday?"

The Clawdis project had a similar problem. The `package.json` file (the main project file) had one version number, but the Mac app might end up with a different one. Confusing!

This fix makes sure the packaging script reads the version from `package.json` and uses that same version when building the Mac app. Now everywhere you look — package.json, the About screen, the `--version` command — it's all the same number.

One source of truth. No more confusion!

## The Changes

Updates `package-mac-app.sh` to read the version number from `package.json` and use it in the app's `Info.plist`. Ensures version consistency across the entire project.
