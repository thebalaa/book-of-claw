title: "Keeping Tool Buttons the Same Size"

## The Translation

In the Tools settings, each tool has action buttons (like "Enable" or "Configure"). But the buttons were different widths depending on their text, making the layout look uneven.

These 6 lines set a stable minimum width for the action area. Now all the buttons line up nicely, even if one says "On" and another says "Configure."

A small visual polish that makes the settings look more professional!

## The Changes

Adds 6 lines to `ToolsSettings.swift` setting a fixed minimum width for tool action buttons to maintain consistent layout.
