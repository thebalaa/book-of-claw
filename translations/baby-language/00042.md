<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00042-b453e285fd-Experiment with Twilio webhook updates -no functional change yet-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter experimented with different ways to update Twilio webhooks, but didn't change the final behavior yet. This is exploratory work - trying different API approaches to see which works best.

It's like sketching different designs on paper before building the real thing. The experiments are in the code but not activated yet - they're behind flags or in commented code.

## The Changes

This commit added experimental webhook update approaches:

- Added alternative API call methods
- Explored different Twilio SDK patterns
- No functional changes to production code yet
- Preparation for upcoming webhook improvements

This is groundwork for future webhook reliability improvements.
