## The Translation

Remember those typing dots that blink while the computer thinks? We had to decide how often to refresh them.

After some testing, the builder decided: every 8 seconds is just right! Not too fast (that would be annoying, like a kid asking "are we there yet?" every two seconds), and not too slow (you might think the computer fell asleep).

This change updates the documentation and code to say "8 seconds" as the magic number. It's like Goldilocks finding the porridge that's just right.

## The Changes

Sets the typing indicator refresh interval to 8 seconds. Updates the README, configuration docs, and code comments to reflect this value as the recommended default.
