## The Translation

When a heartbeat runs, it's helpful to know the state of all conversations. Who are we talking to? How long ago did we chat?

This change makes the system take a "snapshot" of all active sessions when a heartbeat fires. It writes down: "Session with Alice: 5 minutes old. Session with Bob: 2 hours old."

It's like taking a photo of your desk before cleaning it—you can see exactly what was there. This helps developers understand what the system is doing and troubleshoot any weird behavior.

## The Changes

Adds session snapshot logging during heartbeat processing, recording the state of all active sessions including their age and last activity timestamps. This provides visibility into session state when debugging heartbeat behavior.
