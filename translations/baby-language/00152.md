## The Translation

Imagine you're practicing a play, but one character is a strict security guard who won't let anyone through. For rehearsal, you don't need a REAL guard — you just have someone pretend!

The webhook tests needed to check something, but Twilio's authentication (the security guard) kept getting in the way. "Show me your ID! Prove who you are!" But we just want to test the webhook logic!

So we added a "mock" — a pretend security guard who just waves everyone through. One little line that says "Don't worry about auth for this test." Now we can practice our play without interruption!

## The Changes

Adds a mock for Twilio authentication in the update-webhook test file. Allows the test to run without real Twilio credentials.
