## The Translation

The chime system was overbuilt. The Star Trek sound was fun but not necessary. Simplify!

55 lines removed, 22 added:
- Remove custom sound file
- Default to macOS "Glass" sound
- Streamlined code

Sometimes the built-in system sounds are perfect!

## The Changes

Streamlines chime system, removes custom sounds, defaults to Glass sound across 9 files (net -33 lines).
