## The Translation

Voice wake forwarding was complex with direct SSH handling. Simplify: route it through agent RPC!

Major cleanup:
- VoiceWakeForwarder simplified (317 → ~40 lines!)
- Tests updated (57 lines simplified)

297 lines removed, 77 added. Much simpler!

## The Changes

Routes voice wake forwarding via agent RPC. Simplifies VoiceWakeForwarder (240 lines removed) and tests.
