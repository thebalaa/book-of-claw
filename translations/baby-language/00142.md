## The Translation

Modern phones come with certain apps already installed. You don't need to download a calculator — it's built in!

Node now has something called "corepack" that manages package managers like pnpm. Instead of installing pnpm separately, we can just say "Hey corepack, give us pnpm!" and it's ready to go.

We updated the helper robots to use corepack with Node 22. It's cleaner — like using the built-in tools instead of bringing your own. Five lines changed, but the setup is now simpler and more standard.

## The Changes

Switches CI workflow to use corepack for pnpm management with setup-node version 22. Uses the built-in package manager support instead of separate installation.
