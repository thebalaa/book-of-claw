## The Translation

Long texts were filling up the logs! If someone sends a really long message, do we need the entire thing in the log file?

This change "redacts" (hides) long texts in logs. You see "[text: 5000 chars]" instead of 5000 characters. Much cleaner!

## The Changes

Redacts long text content in web logs to prevent log bloat while maintaining useful debugging information.
