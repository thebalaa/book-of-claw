## The Translation

Have you ever asked someone a simple question and they gave you a REALLY long answer? Like, you asked "what's 2+2?" and they explained the entire history of mathematics? Too much!

Clawd was doing something similar. It could write really, really long responses. But WhatsApp messages have limits! If you send too much text, it gets cut off or looks weird.

So we added a reminder in Clawd's instructions: "Keep your responses under 1500 characters." It's like telling someone "Give me the short version, please!" Now Clawd knows to be concise.

## The Changes

Expands the Clawd prompt to include a reminder about the 1500 character limit for responses. Helps ensure replies fit within WhatsApp message constraints.
