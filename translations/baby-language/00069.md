<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00069-ba3b271c39-Parse Claude JSON output to return text replies-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added JSON parsing for Claude responses. When Claude returns JSON with a specific structure, the program now extracts just the text part and sends that as the WhatsApp reply.

This is useful when Claude is configured to return structured data - the program can parse it and send only the relevant reply text.

It's like receiving a formal letter and reading just the main message, ignoring the letterhead and footer.

## The Changes

This commit added Claude JSON parsing:

- Parses JSON output from Claude commands
- Extracts reply text from structured responses
- Handles both text and JSON output formats
- Robust error handling for malformed JSON

Claude's structured responses are now properly processed into WhatsApp messages.
