## The Translation

Sometimes you ask "What's happening?" and someone says "It's fine." But you want MORE details! "What do you MEAN fine? Tell me everything!"

The `send` and `status` commands were like that — they'd tell you the basics but not much more. What if you wanted to debug something? What if you needed ALL the details?

We added a "verbose" flag. When you add `-v` or `--verbose`, the commands get chatty and tell you EVERYTHING they're doing. For debugging, this is super helpful. For normal use, you can skip it.

## The Changes

Adds a verbose flag option to the CLI's send and status commands. When enabled, commands output additional diagnostic information.
