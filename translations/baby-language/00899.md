## The Translation

Bun runtime support was adding complexity without enough benefit. Drop it!

128 lines removed, 58 added:
- RuntimeLocator simplified
- Tests reduced
- Docs deleted
- Focus on Node.js only

Simpler is better!

## The Changes

Drops Bun support from RuntimeLocator, tests, docs, and packaging. 70 net lines removed.
