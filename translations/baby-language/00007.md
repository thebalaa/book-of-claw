## The Translation

Peter added a tiny decoration to make the project look friendlier: a 📡 (satellite dish) emoji in the title of the README file.

Before: "Warelay — WhatsApp Relay CLI (Twilio)"
After: "📡 Warelay — WhatsApp Relay CLI (Twilio)"

That's it! Just a single emoji to make the project feel more welcoming and show at a glance that it's about sending and receiving messages (like a satellite dish sends and receives signals).

Sometimes the smallest changes make things feel more complete. It's like adding a sticker to your lunchbox - doesn't change what's inside, but it makes it yours.

## The Changes

This commit added a 📡 emoji to the beginning of the README title on line 1. Changed the heading from `# Warelay — WhatsApp Relay CLI (Twilio)` to `# 📡 Warelay — WhatsApp Relay CLI (Twilio)`. This is a purely cosmetic change to make the project documentation more visually distinctive and friendly.
