## The Translation

You know how some video games have beautiful, colorful menus, and others just have plain text? Colors make things easier to read and more fun!

When you type `--help` to see what commands are available, it used to be plain boring text. Now it has COLORS! Commands are one color, descriptions are another. There's even a nice example footer showing how to use things.

We added 67 lines of code to make the help screen beautiful. It's still the same information, but now it's pleasing to the eye. The little touches make a big difference!

## The Changes

Adds colorized output and an example footer to CLI help text. Improves the user experience when viewing command help with better formatting and visual hierarchy.
