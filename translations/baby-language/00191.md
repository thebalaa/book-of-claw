## The Translation

Wait, wait, WAIT! We went from 0.1.x to... 1.0.4?! That's a huge jump!

Actually, this might be a typo or a special version for testing. Usually software goes 0.1 → 0.2 → 0.9 → 1.0. But version numbers are just labels — the maintainers decide what they mean.

Either way, a release is a release! The changelog gets updated, the version number changes, and the package is ready for users. Whether it's 1.0.4 or 0.1.4, it represents a stable point where everything works together.

## The Changes

Releases version 1.0.4 with updated changelog documenting recent features including timeout fallback and auto-reconnect functionality.
