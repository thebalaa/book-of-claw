## The Translation

The "heartbeat" is a periodic check that makes sure everything is still working. Like a doctor checking your pulse! But you might want to control how often it checks, or turn it off.

This adds heartbeat controls to the Config settings:
- Enable/disable heartbeat
- Set the interval (how often to check)
- Set the timeout (how long to wait for a response)

49 new lines give you full control over the heartbeat behavior. Customize it to your needs!

## The Changes

Adds heartbeat configuration controls to `ConfigSettings.swift` (49 lines). Includes enable toggle, interval slider, and timeout setting.
