## The Translation

Picture this: you have a flashlight, but it's in a drawer and you're in a dark room. The flashlight exists, but you can't USE it because you don't know where it is!

Computers have the same problem. A tool called "pnpm" was installed, but the computer couldn't find it when it needed to use it. It was like shouting "pnpm, where are you?!" into the void.

We added directions that say "Before you try to use pnpm, make sure you know the path to where it lives." Now the computer always knows where to find its tools.

## The Changes

Adds PATH setup to ensure pnpm is discoverable before running install commands. Exports the PNPM_HOME directory to PATH so the pnpm binary can be found.
