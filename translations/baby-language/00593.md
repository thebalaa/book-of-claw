title: "Creating an RPC Loop for Agent Communication"

## The Translation

RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is like a phone line for programs to talk to each other. This commit builds the actual phone line!

The CLI now has an RPC loop that:
- Reads commands from stdin (standard input)
- Processes them (like "send this message")
- Writes results to stdout (standard output)

It's 74 lines of plumbing that lets other programs communicate with the agent by sending and receiving text lines. The foundation for all agent communication!

## The Changes

Adds 74 lines to `program.ts` implementing a stdin/stdout RPC loop for agent send commands. Enables persistent communication with the agent process.
