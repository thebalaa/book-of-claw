## The Translation

Claude Code has a quirk: exclamation marks (!) sometimes do weird things. It's a known issue, and this change documents a workaround!

The AGENTS.md file now explains how to escape or handle exclamation marks properly. It's like a troubleshooting guide: "If you see this problem, try this solution."

Documenting workarounds saves everyone time!

## The Changes

Adds documentation in AGENTS.md explaining the exclamation mark escaping workaround for Claude Code, helping users avoid a known issue.
