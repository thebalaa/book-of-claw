## The Translation

When you ask the AI to "think harder," it should acknowledge that! This change makes the system respond when it receives think directives.

"Got it, thinking deeply about this..." — now users know their thinking request was received.

A new documentation file for thinking gets started too. Good features deserve good docs!

## The Changes

Adds acknowledgment responses for thinking directives and begins thinking documentation. Includes tests verifying the acknowledgment behavior works correctly.
