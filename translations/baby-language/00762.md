title: "Restarting Tunnel on Main Thread"

## The Translation

Swift apps have a "main actor" where UI work should happen. The tunnel restart was happening on the wrong thread!

4 lines added, 6 removed — the restart now happens on the main actor where it belongs. Safer concurrency.

## The Changes

Fixes `WebChatWindow.swift` (10 lines changed) to restart webchat tunnel on the main actor.
