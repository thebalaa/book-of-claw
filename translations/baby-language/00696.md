## The Translation

The General settings tab was getting crowded. With remote mode, health display, and all the options, it didn't fit anymore!

This wraps the General tab content in a ScrollView. 65 lines added, 63 removed — a refactoring that lets you scroll through all the settings.

## The Changes

Refactors `GeneralSettings.swift` (128 lines changed) to make the General tab scrollable.
