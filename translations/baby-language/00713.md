## The Translation

When connected to a remote Clawdis, the web chat needed to work too! Now it:
- Loads chat history from the remote server
- Sends messages via RPC to the remote server

79 lines added, 50 removed in a big refactoring of WebChatWindow. Remote mode just got a lot more useful!

## The Changes

Updates `WebChatWindow.swift` (127 lines changed) to load history and send messages via RPC when in remote mode.
