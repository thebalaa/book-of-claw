title: "Fixing Another Voice Wake Crash"

## The Translation

The voice wake system was having more hiccups. There was a line of code in the VoiceWakeSettings that was causing trouble with Swift's "actor" system (the thing that prevents code from running at the wrong time).

The fix? Remove that problematic line! Sometimes the best fix is to take away the thing causing problems, like removing a wobbly wheel from a wagon and realizing it actually runs better with three wheels.

This was a one-line delete — the commit message also mentions adding mic entitlement, but that was likely done in connection with the previous commit to make sure voice features work properly.

## The Changes

Removes one problematic line from `VoiceWakeSettings.swift` that was causing actor isolation crashes. Combined with the mic entitlement addition, this ensures voice wake works without crashing.
