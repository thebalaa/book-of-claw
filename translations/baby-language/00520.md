## The Translation

Most people keep their toys in one special spot, right? But what if your Clawdis project isn't in the usual place? Before, you were stuck — the app would look in `~/Projects/clawdis` and nowhere else.

Now there's a text box in the Debug settings where you can type in exactly where *your* Clawdis lives! Maybe it's in `~/code/clawdis` or `~/dev/clawdis` — you can tell the app and it'll remember.

There's also a handy "Reset" button if you want to go back to the default location. Think of it like a GPS that lets you enter a custom address, but also has a "Go Home" button.

The app saves your choice so it remembers next time you open it. No more guessing games about where to find things!

## The Changes

Adds a configurable "Relay project root" field to the Debug settings tab. Users can enter a custom path, save it, or reset to default. The `RelayProcessManager` gains `projectRootPath()` getter and `setProjectRoot(path:)` setter that persists to UserDefaults.
