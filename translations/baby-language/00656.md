title: "Making SSH Logs Easier to Find"

## The Translation

The SSH command logging was at "debug" level, which might be filtered out. Changing to "info" level means it shows up in normal logs.

One line change, but now you don't need to enable debug mode to see what SSH commands are running!

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (1 line) to log SSH commands at info level instead of debug.
