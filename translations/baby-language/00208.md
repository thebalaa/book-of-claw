## The Translation

Okay, this is the BIG cleanup! Imagine going through your entire house and making sure every single thing is in exactly the right place.

This change touches almost every file in the project and makes sure they all use 2-space indentation. It also updates a special rules file (called `biome.json`) that tells future code "this is how we do things here."

Now anyone who writes new code knows: use 2 spaces. The computer will even help remind them if they forget!

The changelog gets a tiny update too—just noting what version we're working on. Like adding today's date to your diary.

## The Changes

Comprehensive formatting pass converting the entire codebase to 2-space indentation. Updates the Biome configuration to enforce this standard going forward. Also includes a minor changelog notation for tracking.
