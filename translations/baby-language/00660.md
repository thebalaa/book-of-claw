title: "Show the SSH Command When It Fails"

## The Translation

When SSH fails, the error message should include what command was tried. Before, you'd see "SSH failed" but not WHAT failed.

Now the error includes the full command. One line makes debugging much easier!

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (1 line) to include the SSH command in failure messages.
