## The Translation

Different systems have different JavaScript runtimes (Node.js, Bun). The app needs to detect which one is available!

Big addition:
- `RuntimeLocator.swift` (149 lines!) — finds the right runtime
- `runtime-guard.ts` (90 lines) with tests (71 lines)
- Packaging simplification

Now the app automatically uses whatever runtime is installed!

## The Changes

Adds RuntimeLocator and runtime-guard for smart runtime detection across Mac and Node code. 450+ lines added.
