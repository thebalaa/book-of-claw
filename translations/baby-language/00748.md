title: "Different Animations for Different Outcomes"

## The Translation

When the overlay dismisses, HOW it dismisses can communicate something:
- Success? Fade up happily!
- Cancelled? Fade out quickly!
- Error? Different animation!

24 lines add outcome-based dismiss animations. The overlay now "speaks" through its animations!

## The Changes

Adds outcome-based dismiss animations to `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (28 lines changed, 24 added, 4 removed).
