## The Translation

Oops! A test file had a small import problem and the linter was complaining. Just a one-line fix to make the tests compile properly.

These tiny fixes keep the codebase healthy!

## The Changes

Fixes a test import in `AgentRPCTests.swift` (1 line changed) to resolve compilation/lint issues.
