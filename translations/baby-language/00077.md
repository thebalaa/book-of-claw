<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00077-8bd406f6b1-feat- add config validation and send dry-run-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added two important features:

**Config validation**: The program now checks your config file for errors when it loads. If you made a typo or invalid setting, it tells you immediately instead of failing mysteriously later.

**Dry-run mode**: You can now test send commands without actually sending messages. Use `--dry-run` to see what would happen without doing it. Great for testing!

## The Changes

- Added config schema validation
- Created dry-run flag for send command
- Validates config structure on load
- Improved error messages for invalid config

Users can now validate config and test sends safely.
