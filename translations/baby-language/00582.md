## The Translation

Clawdis can connect to different chat services — WhatsApp, Web, and maybe others in the future. When you log in or out, it assumed you meant WhatsApp.

Now you can specify which provider with `--provider`:
- `clawdis login --provider whatsapp` (the default)
- `clawdis login --provider web`

This makes the CLI more flexible. You can manage multiple chat services without confusion about which one you're configuring.

## The Changes

Adds `--provider` flag to login and logout CLI commands. Updates `program.ts` (8 lines) and `web/login.ts` (4 lines). Defaults to "whatsapp" for backward compatibility.
