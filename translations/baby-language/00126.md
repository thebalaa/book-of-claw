## The Translation

When you build a Lego castle, you shake it a little to make sure it won't fall apart, right? Testing is the same idea — you try to break your code on purpose to make sure it's strong.

We added 69 new lines of tests! These tests check the tricky situations:
- What if the picture address is wrapped in backticks (those little marks like this: \`MEDIA:photo.jpg\`)?
- What if a web picture fails to load? Does the code cry silently, or does it tell us what went wrong?

Now we're sure the code handles these edge cases properly. It's like practicing for a spelling bee — even the hard words!

## The Changes

Adds test coverage for MEDIA tokens wrapped in backticks and web media fallback logging. Ensures the parser handles code-formatted media paths and logs failures appropriately.
