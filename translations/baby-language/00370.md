## The Translation

There's a setting called "allowFrom" that limits who can talk to the AI. But in groups, if someone not on that list @mentions the AI, it should still respond!

This fix lets group replies bypass the allowFrom restriction. In group chats, anyone can summon the AI.

## The Changes

Fixes group chat replies to bypass the allowFrom restriction, allowing any group member to interact with the AI when mentioned.
