## The Translation

Sometimes when your new toy doesn't work right, you go back to playing with the older one that always works.

Node version 22.9.0 was giving us trouble. It wasn't playing nice with the helper robot. So we said: "Fine! We'll use version 20.18.0 instead."

Version 20 is a bit older, like last year's model, but it works perfectly fine. The helper robot knows exactly how to use it. Sometimes "old and reliable" beats "new and cranky."

## The Changes

Reverts to Node.js 20.18.0 in the CI workflow, falling back from 22.9.0 because the newer version wasn't working with the setup-node action.
