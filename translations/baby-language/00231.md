## The Translation

Remember how heartbeats fall back to the last person we chatted with? Well, it's good to write that down when it happens!

This change adds a log message that says "Hey, I couldn't find an explicit recipient, so I'm using the last person we talked to." It's like keeping a diary entry: "Tuesday: No one called me, so I texted Sarah because she was the last person I talked to."

This helps when debugging. If a heartbeat message goes somewhere unexpected, you can check the logs and see exactly what happened.

## The Changes

Adds logging when the heartbeat fallback to last session contact is used, making it easier to trace message routing decisions during heartbeat-triggered responses.
