## The Translation

After you reorganize your room, you notice little things that need fixing. Maybe a toy ended up in the wrong box, or some shelves are a bit crooked.

SwiftLint is like a neat-freak friend who points out when your code isn't tidy. After splitting the big file into smaller ones, this friend said: "Hey, some of these things could be cleaner!"

This commit fixes those little issues:
- Removed an extra `= nil` that wasn't needed (the friend knows it's nil by default)
- Fixed some indentation that looked a bit off
- Cleaned up how `switch` statements were formatted

These are tiny changes that don't change how the app works — they just make the code prettier and more consistent. Like making sure all your books are standing up straight on the shelf!

## The Changes

Fixes SwiftLint warnings introduced during the AppMain split: removes redundant optional initializers (`= nil`), fixes indentation inconsistencies, cleans up switch case formatting, and addresses minor style issues across the new module files.
