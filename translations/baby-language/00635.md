## The Translation

The heartbeat checks if everything is still working. But sometimes you want to pause it (like during debugging). Now you can toggle it live!

A toggle in the menu bar turns heartbeat on/off, and it talks to the running service via RPC. No restart needed — it responds immediately.

57 new lines across 7 files wire up this live control.

## The Changes

Adds heartbeat toggle with live RPC control across AgentRPC, AppState, Constants, MenuBar, CLI, and auto-reply. 57 lines total.
