## The Translation

Sometimes you want the chat window to open automatically when something happens — like when you get a new message or when the app starts.

This commit adds:
1. **Auto-open flag** — A setting that lets the app automatically open the web chat window
2. **Verbose logging** — More detailed messages about what's happening, helpful for debugging

The MenuBar gets 8 lines to handle the flag, and WebChatWindow gets 48 lines of improved logging. Now you can see exactly what the chat window is doing and have it open when needed!

## The Changes

Adds webchat auto-open functionality and verbose logging to `MenuBar.swift` (8 lines) and `WebChatWindow.swift` (48 lines). Enables automatic chat window display and detailed debug output.
