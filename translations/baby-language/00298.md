## The Translation

What if you don't want to use Claude? What if you prefer a different AI?

This change makes the system "pluggable"—you can choose different AI backends! There's Claude (of course), but also Codex, OpenCode, and Pi. Each one is like a different expert you can consult.

The new "agents" folder has a file for each AI type, explaining how to talk to it. Pick your favorite!

## The Changes

Adds pluggable agent architecture with support for multiple AI backends including Claude, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi. Creates an agents module with separate implementations for each CLI and documentation explaining the agent system.
