## The Translation

Have you ever gotten a new gadget with NO instructions? You just stare at it going "how does this work?!" Good instructions are super important.

People were asking: "How do I set up the Claude CLI to work with this project?" We didn't have a good answer written down anywhere.

So we wrote a 90-line guide explaining exactly how to configure Claude! Step by step: where to find settings, what to put in them, how to test if it's working. We even linked to it from the main README so people can find it easily. No more confusion!

## The Changes

Adds comprehensive Claude CLI configuration documentation (docs/claude-config.md) with 90 lines of setup instructions. Links to this new guide from the README.
