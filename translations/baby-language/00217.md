## The Translation

When you make changes to a project, it's polite to write them down in a special list so people know what's new. That list is called a "changelog"—like a diary for the project!

This change adds a note about the auto-reply code being split into smaller files. Now anyone who reads the changelog can see: "Oh, the reply code was reorganized. Good to know!"

It's like leaving a sticky note on the fridge saying "I moved the leftovers to the bottom shelf."

## The Changes

Adds a changelog entry documenting the auto-reply module refactoring, noting that reply helpers were split into separate modules for better organization.
