## The Translation

Sound effects were only in VoiceWakeChime. Other features might want sounds too! Centralize them.

New `SoundEffects.swift` (107 lines) provides:
- Sound catalog
- Play functionality
- Easy reuse

VoiceWakeChime gets simplified (84 lines removed).

## The Changes

Creates `SoundEffects.swift` (107 lines) for centralized sound management. Simplifies VoiceWakeChime (84 lines removed).
