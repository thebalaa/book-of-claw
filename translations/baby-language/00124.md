## The Translation

When the automatic helper keeps failing, sometimes you just have to do things by hand. Like if the dishwasher is broken, you wash the dishes yourself!

The helper robot actions for setting up Node kept breaking. Different versions, missing paths, weird errors. Enough was enough!

So we added instructions to manually download and install Node 22.9.0 ourselves. It's more steps, but now we KNOW exactly what's happening. We're in control. Sometimes the DIY approach is more reliable than fancy automation that keeps breaking.

## The Changes

Adds manual Node.js 22.9.0 installation steps to the CI workflow, bypassing the problematic setup-node action entirely. Downloads the tarball directly and sets up PATH manually.
