## The Translation

As you speak, the transcription updates in real-time. But early transcriptions are uncertain — let's show that visually!

Partial transcripts now have a "subdued tint" — they look lighter until the transcription is final. Plus more stable delay timing.

38 lines added, 12 removed. Better visual feedback!

## The Changes

Adds partial transcript tinting to `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (20 lines) and stabilizes delays in `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (30 lines).
