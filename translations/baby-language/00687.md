## The Translation

The health label age was showing wrong! Maybe it said "0s ago" when it should say "2m ago", or the format was off.

3 lines fix how the age string is displayed. Now it shows correctly!

## The Changes

Fixes health label age string in `MenuBar.swift` (6 lines changed, 3 net changes).
