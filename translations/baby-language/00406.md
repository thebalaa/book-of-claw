## The Translation

The RPC system was sometimes sending duplicate replies when tools were called! The "toolcall delta" events were triggering extra responses.

This fix ignores those intermediate events, so you only get the final reply. No more doubles!

## The Changes

Fixes duplicate reply issue by ignoring RPC toolcall delta events that were causing redundant responses.
