## The Translation

Another release! Version 1.2.2 brings those heartbeat improvements—custom messages and dry-run mode—to everyone.

The changelog gets its date, the package.json gets bumped, and the new features are officially out in the world.

Frequent small releases are better than rare big ones—users get improvements faster!
