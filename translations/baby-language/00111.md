## The Translation

Imagine you have different versions of your favorite toy — like Lego sets that come out every year. Sometimes the newest set has pieces that don't fit with older instructions.

The robot helpers that check our code needed a specific version of their toolbox called "Node." The builder was trying to use version 22.11.0, but the helper robot said "I don't have that one!"

So we told it: "Use version 22.9.0 instead — that's one we know you have!" It's like asking for chocolate ice cream when the shop is out of mint chip. You pick what's actually available.

## The Changes

Updates the CI workflow to use Node.js 22.9.0 instead of 22.11.0, because the latter wasn't available in the setup-node action's manifest.
