## The Translation

Imagine you have a toy box with lots of buttons on it. Some buttons are really useful and you use them all the time. Other buttons? Not so much — maybe you only need them when something goes wrong.

The "Reload Models" button was like that. It sat right there in the settings where everyone could see it, but most people never needed to press it. It was kind of like having an "Emergency Reset" button right next to your normal "Play" button — a bit confusing!

So this change tidies things up. It moves the reload button somewhere else (the Debug tab, where the technical stuff lives) and leaves just a simple message if something goes wrong with loading the AI models. Now the settings look cleaner and less cluttered!

## The Changes

Removes the "Reload models" button from the Config settings tab, leaving only the error text display. The reload functionality was moved to the Debug tab in a separate commit. This simplifies the Config UI for regular users.
