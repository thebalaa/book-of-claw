## The Translation

Peter configured GitHub Actions to run the test suite automatically on every push and pull request. Now tests run in CI (Continuous Integration) - if someone commits code that breaks tests, the automated system catches it immediately.

It's like having a robot check every homework assignment to make sure it's correct before accepting it.

## The Changes

- Added vitest to GitHub Actions workflow
- Tests run automatically on push/PR
- Catches breaking changes before merge
- Automated quality assurance

Tests now run automatically in CI to catch problems early.
