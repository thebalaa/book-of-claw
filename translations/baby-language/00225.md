## The Translation

The big web provider reorganization is done! Time to clean up the construction mess.

This change removes the temporary planning documents that guided the refactoring—they're like the blueprints you don't need after the house is built.

But it also adds more tests! The login code gets extra coverage tests to make sure every path through the code is checked. It's like a teacher making sure every question on the test has been answered.

The README also gets updated so people know about all the new modular structure.

## The Changes

Finalizes the web provider refactoring by removing temporary documentation files and adding additional test coverage. Introduces a barrel test for the provider and comprehensive login coverage tests. Updates the README to reflect the new modular architecture.
