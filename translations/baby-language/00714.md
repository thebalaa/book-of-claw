title: "Capturing What You Said After the Trigger"

## The Translation

Voice wake detects your trigger phrase, but what about what comes AFTER? "Hey Clawdis, what's the weather?" — we need to capture "what's the weather?"

This big improvement:
- Captures the full utterance after the trigger
- Adds an optional prefix to the command
- Better tests (9 lines)
- New documentation (28 lines)

164 new lines make voice commands much more capable!

## The Changes

Adds utterance capture to VoiceWakeRuntime (106 lines), forwarder prefix support, state management, tests, and documentation across 7 files.
