title: "/new Works After Timestamps"

## The Translation

When timestamps are prepended to messages, the "/new" command to reset sessions wasn't being detected properly!

Now it looks for /new even after the timestamp prefix. "[14:30] /new" correctly resets the session.

## The Changes

Fixes /new session reset detection to work when messages have timestamp prefixes.
