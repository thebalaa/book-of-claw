## The Translation

When the agent is working on a job, you want to know its state! This emits events from RPC about job status.

87 new lines:
- AgentRPC emits events (44 lines)
- CLI sends state updates (31 lines)
- Tests verify behavior (17 lines)

Now you can track what the agent is doing!

## The Changes

Adds job-state event emission to AgentRPC (44 lines) and CLI (31 lines), with tests (17 lines).
