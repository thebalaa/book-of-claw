<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00095-daf45190a9-chore- add color to web auto-reply log-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added colored output to web provider auto-reply logs, matching the color scheme used by the Twilio provider. Success messages are green, errors are red, etc.

Consistent, colorful logging across both providers!

## The Changes

- Added chalk colors to web auto-reply logs
- Matched Twilio provider color scheme
- Improved log readability
- Visual consistency across providers

Web provider logs now have helpful colors like Twilio logs.
