## The Translation

Have you ever changed your clothes but forgot to take off the old shirt first? You end up wearing two shirts! Silly, right?

Something similar can happen with code. When you change the code, the relay (the messenger that talks to people) might still be running the OLD code. It doesn't magically know you updated things!

We added a reminder note in the AGENTS.md file: "Hey, after you change the code, don't forget to restart the relay in tmux!" It's like a sticky note on the fridge reminding you to take out the trash.

## The Changes

Adds documentation to AGENTS.md reminding developers to restart the relay tmux session after making code changes. Prevents confusion when edits don't seem to take effect.
