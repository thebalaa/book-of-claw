<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00032-13355b11d8-Update README for up-poll workflow and aliases-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter updated the README (the instruction manual) to match all the recent changes.

The biggest update: the `setup` command is now called `up`. The README now says "Webhook/funnel 'up'" instead of "Setup helper."

He also added documentation for the new `poll` command - explaining it's a fallback when webhooks don't work. The instructions now show two paths: the fancy webhook way (with `up`) and the simpler polling way (with `poll`).

It's like updating a guidebook when the directions change - you don't want people following old instructions that use the wrong command names!

## The Changes

This commit updated the README to match recent command changes:

- Changed "Setup helper" to "Webhook/funnel 'up'"
- Renamed command from `setup` to `up` in examples
- Added new section documenting `poll` command: "Polling mode (no webhooks/funnel)"
- Explained polling is a "useful fallback if Twilio webhook can't reach you"

Now the README accurately reflects the current command structure.
