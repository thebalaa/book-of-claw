## The Translation

How long should we wait to batch tools together? The original timing was too fast—tools were being sent separately anyway.

Changing the batch window to 1 second gives more time for rapid tools to collect together. Now more tools get batched into fewer messages.

Timing tuning!

## The Changes

Increases the tool batching window to 1 second, allowing more tool results to be collected before sending.
