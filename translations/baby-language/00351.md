## The Translation

When the AI uses lots of tools quickly, sending a message for each one would flood your chat! Instead, we "batch" them—collect several tool results and send them together.

It's like getting one email with "Here's what I did" instead of ten separate emails for each tiny step.

Less spam, same information!

## The Changes

Implements batching for rapid tool results, collecting multiple quick tool outputs into combined messages rather than sending each individually.
