## The Translation

Running two relay instances would cause chaos! Now the relay enforces a single instance lock.

137 new lines:
- `relay-lock.ts` (94 lines) — the lock mechanism
- Tests (29 lines)
- CLI integration (14 lines)

Only one relay runs at a time!

## The Changes

Adds single instance lock with `relay-lock.ts` (94 lines), tests (29 lines), and CLI integration.
