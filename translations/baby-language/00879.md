## The Translation

Push-to-talk was sending/dismissing immediately on key release. But what if transcription isn't finished?

65 lines add waiting for the final transcript:
- Wait for speech recognition to finalize
- Then send or dismiss
- More reliable results!

## The Changes

Waits for final transcript before send/dismiss in `VoicePushToTalk.swift` (100 lines changed, 65 added).
