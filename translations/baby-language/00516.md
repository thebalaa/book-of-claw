title: "Giving the App a Stable ID Card"

## The Translation

Every time you go to a new school, you get a new student ID number. That's fine for people, but imagine if your library card changed every time you got a haircut! The librarian would never remember you're allowed to borrow books.

Mac apps have this same problem. They need permission to use your microphone, control your screen, and do other things. Mac remembers "yes, app XYZ-123 can use the mic." But every time developers rebuild the app, it got a new "ID number," and Mac would forget all the permissions!

This fix gives the debug version of Clawdis a stable ID card: `com.steipete.clawdis.debug`. Now when you rebuild the app, Mac still recognizes it and remembers all your permission settings. No more re-granting access after every update!

The script also "signs" the app (like stamping an official seal) so Mac trusts it's the same app each time.

## The Changes

Updates `package-mac-app.sh` to use a stable bundle identifier (`com.steipete.clawdis.debug`) for debug builds. Adds ad-hoc codesigning of the main binary, CLI helper, and app bundle to preserve TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions between rebuilds.
