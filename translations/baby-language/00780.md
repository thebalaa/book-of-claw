## The Translation

The solid background was readable but lost the macOS "vibrancy" effect (that nice blurred background look). Let's have both!

22 lines bring back vibrancy while keeping the label bright and properly wrapped. Best of both worlds!

## The Changes

Restores vibrancy, brightens label, and ensures proper wrapping in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (30 lines changed).
