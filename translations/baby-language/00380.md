## The Translation

When showing tool results, we were accidentally putting multiple emojis sometimes. One emoji per line is plenty!

This fix ensures each verbose tool line gets just one emoji. Clean and simple.

## The Changes

Fixes verbose output to show only a single emoji per tool result line.
