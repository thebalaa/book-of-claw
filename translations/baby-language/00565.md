## The Translation

When you set up something complicated, it helps to write down how it works! That way, other people (or future-you) can understand it.

XPC is the way different parts of Clawdis communicate on Mac. This new documentation file explains:
- What XPC is (inter-process communication)
- How Clawdis uses it
- How to set it up properly
- What to do if things go wrong

Good documentation is like leaving a map for treasure hunters. Now anyone can understand how the pieces fit together!

## The Changes

Adds `docs/mac/xpc.md` (33 lines) documenting the XPC setup for the Mac app, including Mach service registration and client authentication.
