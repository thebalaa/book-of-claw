## The Translation

The grammY research notes were in a `research/` subfolder. But they're useful general documentation, so they move up to the main `docs/` folder.

Also 19 lines of CLI improvements get squeezed in. A small reorganization!

## The Changes

Moves `grammy.md` from `docs/research/` to `docs/`. Updates CLI program with 19 lines of improvements.
