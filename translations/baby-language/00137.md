## The Translation

Have you ever had a little notebook where you jot down ideas, drawings, or stuff you want to remember? It's super handy!

We told Clawd (our AI assistant) about a special folder at `~/clawd` where it can keep notes. It's like a scratchpad — a place to write down markdown files with thoughts, plans, or whatever it needs to remember.

Before, Clawd had nowhere to put things. Now it has its own personal notebook space. Much better for an assistant that needs to keep track of stuff!

## The Changes

Updates the Clawd prompt to mention the ~/clawd markdown scratchpad directory. Informs the AI it can use this location for storing notes and files.
