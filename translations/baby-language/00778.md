## The Translation

The display label was a bit dim and didn't wrap text properly. Long commands would run off screen!

11 lines fix both:
- Brighter, more readable text
- Proper word wrapping

19 lines removed (cleanup). Better readability!

## The Changes

Brightens display label and adds proper text wrapping in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (30 lines changed).
