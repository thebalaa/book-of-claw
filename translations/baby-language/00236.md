## The Translation

New feature? Write it down! The heartbeat idle override setting gets added to the documentation so everyone knows it exists.

The changelog says "Hey, you can now control whether heartbeats reset session timers!" The README mentions it. The heartbeat guide explains how to use it.

It's like updating the instruction manual every time you add a new button to a toy. You don't want people wondering "what does this switch do?"

## The Changes

Documents the `heartbeatIdleOverride` configuration option across the changelog, README, and heartbeat documentation. Also adds a test annotation to improve coverage tracking.
