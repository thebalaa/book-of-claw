## The Translation

Imagine a phone call that drops, and instead of you having to redial, the phone automatically reconnects! "Sorry about that, I'm back!"

The web relay uses something called Baileys to connect to WhatsApp. Sometimes that connection drops — maybe the internet blipped, maybe WhatsApp had a hiccup. Before, you'd have to manually restart things. Annoying!

Now it auto-reconnects! If the connection drops, it waits a moment and tries again automatically. This is a BIG change — 253 new lines, including tests to make sure it works. Much more reliable!

## The Changes

Adds automatic reconnection for Baileys (WhatsApp Web library). When the connection drops, the relay automatically attempts to reconnect. Includes 60 lines of tests.
