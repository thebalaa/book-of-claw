<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00044-12a3c11c6d-Improve Twilio webhook update flow-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter cleaned up and organized the webhook update code. With four different fallback methods, the code was getting messy. He restructured it to be clearer: try each method in order, log what's happening, fail gracefully.

It's like organizing a messy toolbox - the tools are the same, but now they're in neat compartments so you can find what you need.

## The Changes

This commit refactored webhook update flow:

- Reorganized fallback methods into clearer sequential attempts
- Improved logging for each attempt
- Better error messages showing which methods were tried
- Cleaned up error handling

The code does the same thing but is now much easier to understand and maintain.
