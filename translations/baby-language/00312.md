## The Translation

When Twilio sends media files, sometimes the URL says "actually, go look over THERE" (a redirect). The code wasn't following those redirect signs!

Now it does! If Twilio says "the picture is actually at this other address," the code follows the redirect and gets the file from the right place.

It's like following "moved to room 302" signs at a hotel.

## The Changes

Fixes media download handling to properly follow HTTP redirects when fetching Twilio media files.
