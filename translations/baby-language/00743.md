## The Translation

The delay logic was starting immediately after the trigger. But what if the user pauses before saying their command?

Now it waits for actual post-trigger content before starting the delay timer. 25 new lines, 19 removed — smarter waiting logic with 12 more test lines!

## The Changes

Fixes delay logic in `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (32 lines changed) to wait for post-trigger content. Adds tests (12 lines).
