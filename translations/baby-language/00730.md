title: "Finding Files in Packaged Apps"

## The Translation

When an app is "packaged" (bundled for distribution), files are in different places than during development. The webchat server couldn't find its static files!

8 lines fix the path resolution so the server finds its HTML, CSS, and JS files whether running in development or as a packaged app.

## The Changes

Updates `server.ts` (9 lines) to resolve static root correctly in packaged applications.
