## The Translation

Have you ever looked at something that's too dark or too bright? It can be hard on your eyes!

The "tool cards" (little boxes showing each tool/feature) in the Tools settings were a bit too dark. This small change lightens them up a bit so they're easier to look at. It's like turning up the brightness just a touch.

The change is just a color adjustment — making the background of the cards a lighter shade. A small tweak that makes the whole screen feel friendlier.

## The Changes

Adjusts the background color of tool cards in `ToolsSettings.swift` to be lighter. A 2-line change for better visual appearance and readability.
