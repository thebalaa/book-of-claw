title: "Arrays in the Function Signature"

## The Translation

A function's "signature" is like its promise: "I accept these things and I return that thing."

The reply function's signature needed to say "I can return an array (list) of payloads, not just one." This tiny change updates that promise.

Now the function honestly advertises what it can do!

## The Changes

Updates the reply function signature to properly allow array payloads in its return type.
