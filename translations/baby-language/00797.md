title: "Mac App Uses Control Channel"

## The Translation

The Mac app now uses the control channel for health and heartbeat! No more spawning CLI commands.

Big addition:
- `ControlChannel.swift` (273 lines!) — native control channel client
- Health and heartbeat stores updated
- Cleaner, faster communication

348 lines added, 54 removed. Much more efficient!

## The Changes

Adds `ControlChannel.swift` (273 lines), updates GeneralSettings, HealthStore, HeartbeatStore, and MenuBar to use control channel.
