<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00107-f4c5f2c193-test- cover media url extraction from command stdout-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added comprehensive tests for media URL extraction from command output. Commands can return media URLs in their output, and the program needs to parse those correctly.

The tests ensure this parsing works reliably.

## The Changes

- Added tests for media URL parsing
- Covers various URL formats
- Ensures robust media extraction
- High coverage for media handling

Media URL extraction is now well-tested.
