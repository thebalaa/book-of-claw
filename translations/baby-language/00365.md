## The Translation

Sometimes things get stuck and you need to restart. Now there's a "/restart" command that restarts the whole warelay system!

It's like turning your computer off and on again, but you can do it from WhatsApp. Very handy when something goes wrong.

The new code lives in its own file: `restart.ts`.

## The Changes

Adds `/restart` command to restart the warelay WhatsApp connection from within the chat interface.
