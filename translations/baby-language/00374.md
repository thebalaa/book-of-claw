## The Translation

Some WhatsApp messages are special: "ephemeral" (they disappear) or "view-once" (you can only see them once). These were causing problems!

This fix "unwraps" those special messages to get the actual content inside. It also keeps track of who was @mentioned.

Now special messages work just like regular ones.

## The Changes

Fixes handling of ephemeral and view-once messages by unwrapping their content. Also preserves mention information when processing these messages.
