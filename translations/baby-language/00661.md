title: "How to Log Without Privacy Redaction"

## The Translation

macOS logs can redact (hide) sensitive info for privacy. But when debugging, you need to see everything!

This new documentation explains how to disable privacy redaction for logging:
- What the setting does
- How to enable it
- When to use it (only for debugging!)

31 lines of helpful guidance.

## The Changes

Adds `docs/mac/logging.md` (31 lines) documenting how to enable privacy-off logging for debugging.
