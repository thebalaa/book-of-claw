title: "Telling You When the SSH Key is Missing"

## The Translation

If you configure an SSH identity (key file) but the file doesn't exist, that's a problem! Before, it would fail mysteriously.

Now the UI shows "Identity not found" when your configured key file is missing. Clear feedback!

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeSettings.swift` (4 lines changed) to display "identity not found" when configured SSH key doesn't exist.
