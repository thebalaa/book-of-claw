## The Translation

The overlay had a translucent (see-through) background. But that made text harder to read against busy backgrounds.

One line change makes it solid. Better readability wins over style!

## The Changes

Removes translucency from overlay background in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (1 line).
