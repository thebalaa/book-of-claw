title: "Fixing the Web Chat's Path and Errors"

## The Translation

The web chat agent couldn't find commands because PATH wasn't set correctly. And when errors happened, they weren't being shown!

9 new lines:
- Fix the PATH so the agent can find commands
- Surface stderr (error output) so you can see what went wrong

Better debugging, more reliable operation!

## The Changes

Updates `WebChatWindow.swift` (11 lines changed) to fix agent PATH and display stderr messages.
