## The Translation

What do you do when you ask someone a question and they just... don't answer? Awkward silence. You can't just stand there forever!

The auto-reply code had this problem. When it ran a command and got nothing back (empty silence), it didn't know what to do. It might crash or act weird.

Now it handles silence gracefully. If a command returns nothing, the code shrugs and moves on. "Okay, no answer? That's fine, I'll deal with it." Much more mature behavior!

## The Changes

Improves auto-reply to handle empty stdout gracefully. Adds null/empty checks and tests to ensure the system doesn't crash or misbehave when a command produces no output.
