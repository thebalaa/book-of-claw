## The Translation

The reconnection code—the part that tries to reconnect when you get disconnected—was living inside a bigger file. But it's important enough to deserve its own room!

So the builder extracted all the "try again if disconnected" logic into a new file called `reconnect.ts`. It's like giving the reconnection robot its own workshop where it can focus on just one thing: getting back online.

Now it's easier to test, easier to fix, and easier to understand. Plus, it got its own test file too!

## The Changes

Extracts reconnection handling logic from `auto-reply.ts` into a dedicated `reconnect.ts` module. Adds comprehensive tests in `reconnect.test.ts` covering retry logic, backoff timing, and failure scenarios. The main module becomes simpler by delegating reconnection concerns to this focused helper.
