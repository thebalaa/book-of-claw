## The Translation

Here's a tricky problem: what if you're using the AI on the SAME phone you're texting from? When you send a message, your phone sends it... but then the phone also RECEIVES it (because it's watching all messages). Echo!

"Same-phone mode" solves this! The system detects when a message is an echo (your own message bouncing back) and ignores it. There's also a configurable marker you can use to tag messages in special ways.

It's like knowing not to answer your own reflection in a mirror!

## The Changes

Implements same-phone mode with echo detection to handle scenarios where the relay runs on the same device as the WhatsApp client. Adds configurable marker support and tests for echo filtering logic.
