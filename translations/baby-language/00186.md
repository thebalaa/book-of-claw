## The Translation

We just released 0.1.3, and already we're preparing for 0.1.4! Development never stops!

This is housekeeping — setting up the structure for the next version:
- Add an "Unreleased" placeholder in the changelog (where we'll write new stuff)
- Update version numbers to 0.1.4-dev or similar
- Add some "guardrails" to the release process (rules to prevent mistakes)

It's like after a party, you clean up and immediately start thinking about the next one. The version number moves forward, and the cycle continues!

## The Changes

Prepares for version 0.1.4 development with changelog placeholder and release process guardrails. Updates version references across multiple files.
