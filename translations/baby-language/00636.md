## The Translation

The voice wake test button was hardcoded — it always tested the same way. But you've configured custom settings! The test should use YOUR settings.

Now the test follows your config:
- Uses your SSH target
- Uses your trigger phrases
- Uses your timeout settings

47 new lines make the test realistic!

## The Changes

Updates `DebugSettings.swift` (58 lines changed) to make voice wake test use current configuration settings instead of hardcoded values.
