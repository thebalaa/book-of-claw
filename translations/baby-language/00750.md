## The Translation

The voice wake was finalizing too quickly — sometimes before you finished speaking! Now it waits for a full 1 second of silence.

8 lines removed, 2 added. Simpler logic that actually works better!

## The Changes

Fixes `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (10 lines changed) to only finalize after a full 1 second of silence.
