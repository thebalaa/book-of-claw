## The Translation

Sometimes documentation needs a big "WARNING!" sign. This change adds a disclaimer to the Claude config docs.

Maybe it warns about security risks, or tricky configurations, or things that could break. Whatever it is, the builder wanted to make sure people see it before they start changing settings.

It's like the "caution: hot" label on a coffee cup. Better to warn people upfront!

## The Changes

Adds a warning disclaimer section to the Claude configuration documentation, alerting users to important considerations before modifying their setup.
