## The Translation

Imagine you ask a friend a question, and they just... don't answer. You wait, and wait, and wait. Eventually, you have to give up and try something else!

The auto-reply system sends messages to Claude and waits for a response. But what if Claude takes forever? Or never responds? The system would just hang there!

Now we have a timeout fallback. If the response takes too long, we send a polite message like "Sorry, that took too long, try again!" Plus we added 60 lines of tests to make sure this safety net works.

## The Changes

Adds timeout fallback handling to auto-reply. When Claude takes too long to respond, sends a graceful timeout message. Includes comprehensive tests for the new behavior.
