## The Translation

The web chat UI was embedded directly in Swift code as strings. That's messy — hard to edit, hard to debug!

This refactoring:
- Creates a proper `index.html` file (143 lines)
- Loads the HTML from the bundle
- Removes 158 lines of embedded HTML strings

Now the web chat HTML is a real file you can edit with any HTML editor!

## The Changes

Adds `Resources/WebChat/index.html` (143 lines) and refactors `WebChatWindow.swift` (158 lines removed) to load from the bundled file.
