title: "No API Key Prompts in the App"

## The Translation

The web chat UI normally asks for API keys (to connect to AI services). But when embedded in the Mac app, the keys are handled differently — no need to prompt!

This bypasses those API key prompts in embedded mode. Users see a cleaner experience without annoying popups asking for keys.

17 lines across 3 files make the embedded chat smoother.

## The Changes

Adds API key prompt bypass in embedded mode to `ChatPanel.js` (2 lines), `bootstrap.js` (8 lines), and bundle (7 lines).
