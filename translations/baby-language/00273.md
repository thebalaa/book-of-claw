## The Translation

When you receive a picture, how do you know if it's a JPEG, PNG, or GIF? You could look at the filename... but sometimes filenames lie!

This change adds "mime sniffing"—looking at the actual contents of the file to figure out what type it really is. It's like opening a box to see what's inside instead of trusting the label.

Now the system keeps the correct file extensions based on what the file actually is, not what someone claimed it was.

## The Changes

Implements MIME type detection by inspecting file contents (magic bytes) rather than relying solely on file extensions. Creates a new mime utility module and updates the media store to preserve correct extensions based on detected content type.
