## The Translation

Passing text through stdin can be tricky — special characters, newlines, and quotes cause problems. A safer way is to encode the text!

This change uses Python to base64-encode the transcript before sending. Base64 turns any text into safe characters that won't break the command. The remote side decodes it back to normal text.

4 lines added, 8 removed — simpler and more reliable!

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (12 lines changed) to send transcripts via Python/base64 encoding instead of stdin.
