<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00083-af577f07da-refactor- add provider barrels and webhook grouping-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added "barrel" files - index files that re-export everything from a module directory. This makes imports cleaner: instead of `import { X } from './provider/specific/file'` you can do `import { X } from './provider'`.

He also grouped webhook-related code together.

It's like having a reception desk that directs you to the right person instead of wandering the halls looking for offices.

## The Changes

- Added barrel exports for provider modules
- Grouped webhook functionality
- Cleaner import statements
- Better module organization

Imports are now simpler and more organized.
