## The Translation

Remember Clawd's notebook (the scratchpad)? At first we said "you can write markdown notes there." But what if Clawd wants to save a picture someone sent? Or a diagram?

We updated the instructions: "You can save markdown files OR images in your scratchpad." Now the notebook is more versatile — it's like a scrapbook that can hold both written notes AND photos.

And we reminded Clawd again about keeping messages short. (Sometimes you need to repeat important reminders, just like your parents telling you to brush your teeth!)

## The Changes

Updates the Clawd prompt to allow both markdown files and images in the scratchpad. Reiterates the message length constraint for good measure.
