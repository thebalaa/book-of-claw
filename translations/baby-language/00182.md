## The Translation

"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS SECTION" is a mouthful. "FAQ" is simpler. Or just "Questions" or "Help." Short and sweet!

The README had a FAQ heading that was maybe too long or too formal. We simplified it. Made it easier to read, easier to scan, easier to find what you're looking for.

Documentation should be welcoming, not intimidating. One small word change can make a whole section feel more approachable. That's the power of good editing!

## The Changes

Simplifies the FAQ section heading in the README. Makes the documentation more scannable and user-friendly.
