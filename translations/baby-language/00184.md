## The Translation

When you run a command on a computer, it runs in a specific folder (directory). It's like if someone said "clean your room" — they need to specify WHICH room!

Before, commands would run in whatever folder the system happened to be in. But what if you wanted them to run in a specific place? 

Now there's a `cwd` option (stands for "current working directory"). You can say "run this command, but do it FROM this folder." It's like giving GPS coordinates — now the command knows exactly where to be!

## The Changes

Adds a cwd (current working directory) option for command replies. Allows specifying which directory commands should execute in. Updates docs and changelog.
