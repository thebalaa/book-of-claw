title: "Streaming Pi's Responses"

## The Translation

When Pi (the AI) is writing a response, you can now see it as it's typed! The text streams in piece by piece instead of all at once at the end.

It's like watching someone write on a whiteboard versus waiting for them to flip a finished page. More engaging!

## The Changes

Implements streaming of Pi assistant text during RPC runs, showing responses progressively as they're generated.
