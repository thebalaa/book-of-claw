## The Translation

You know those red squiggly lines under misspelled words? Code has something similar called "lint warnings." They're not errors (the code still works), but they're like the code saying "this could be better!"

We had a bunch of these warnings piling up. The Node path was also a bit wonky. Time for a cleanup!

Five files got touched. We fixed the way things are organized, made functions cleaner, and got rid of those pesky warnings. It's like tidying your room — everything still works, but now it looks nicer and the grown-ups stop nagging.

## The Changes

Fixes Node path configuration in CI and addresses lint warnings across multiple source files. Cleans up code style in claude.ts, config.ts, provider-web files, and more.
