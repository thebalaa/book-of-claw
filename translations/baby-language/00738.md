## The Translation

When you say the trigger phrase, something should SHOW on screen! Enter the voice wake overlay.

A beautiful visual indicator:
- Shows when listening
- Animates while processing
- Displays what was heard

291 lines create `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift`. The runtime gets 39 lines of integration. Voice wake just got a lot more visual!

## The Changes

Adds `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (291 lines) for visual voice wake indicator. Updates `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (39 lines) for integration.
