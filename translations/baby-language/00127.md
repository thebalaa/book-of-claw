## The Translation

Imagine you're copying a phone number someone wrote, but they accidentally put a period at the end: "555-1234." If you dial that period, the call won't work!

Same problem with picture addresses. Sometimes they have commas, periods, or other punctuation stuck to the end. The code needs to snip off those extra bits to find the real file.

We made the picture-finder smarter: it now carefully removes trailing punctuation before looking for the file. And we added 25 lines of tests to make sure it handles all sorts of messy endings — periods, commas, question marks, you name it!

## The Changes

Enhances MEDIA token parsing to strip trailing punctuation marks. Adds comprehensive tests for various punctuation scenarios like `.`, `,`, `!`, `?` at the end of media paths.
