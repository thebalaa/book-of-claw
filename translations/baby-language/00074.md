## The Translation

Peter improved the documentation explaining how Claude's output is handled. He clarified when JSON parsing happens, when text mode is used, and how the program decides which format to expect.

Better docs mean fewer confused users!

## The Changes

This commit improved Claude output docs:

- Clarified JSON vs text mode behavior
- Explained output format detection
- Added examples of each mode
- Improved inline comments

Users now have clear guidance on configuring Claude output format.
