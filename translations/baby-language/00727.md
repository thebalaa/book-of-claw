## The Translation

The webchat server used to need manual starting. Now it auto-starts when needed!

Also simplified the config — fewer things to configure, more things "just work". 56 lines added, 20 removed across CLI, config, and server.

## The Changes

Updates CLI, config, and server (56 lines) to auto-start webchat server and simplify configuration.
