## The Translation

Escaping text is tricky — special characters like quotes and newlines can break things. These regression tests verify that escaping works correctly!

10 new test lines check various edge cases. Plus 4 more lines in the packaging script. Now we can be confident that future changes won't break escaping.

## The Changes

Adds escaping regression tests to `VoiceWakeForwarderTests.swift` (10 lines) and updates packaging script (4 lines).
