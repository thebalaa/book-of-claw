## The Translation

When you split your tests into smaller files, you also need to make sure each file asks for exactly what it needs—no more, no less.

Think of it like packing your backpack for school. You don't bring your entire bookshelf! You bring just the books you need for today's classes.

This change goes through each test file and makes sure the "import" statements (the lines that say "I need these tools") are nice and tidy. Each test file now clearly says which helpers it's using and gets them from the right place.

Small change, but it makes everything cleaner and easier to understand.

## The Changes

Organizes and cleans up import statements across the web module test files, ensuring each test properly imports from the shared test-helpers module and references the correct paths after the module split.
