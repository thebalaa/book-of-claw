title: "Checking if the Remote Computer Has Clawdis"

## The Translation

When you forward voice commands to another computer via SSH, you want to make sure that computer actually has Clawdis installed! Otherwise, what's the point?

The SSH connectivity check now also verifies:
1. Can we connect? (the old check)
2. Is `clawdis-mac` installed on the remote machine? (new!)

If the remote machine doesn't have Clawdis, the test will warn you. Better to find out during setup than when you try to use a voice command and it fails!

## The Changes

Enhances `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (38 lines changed, 33 added) to verify the remote `clawdis-mac` executable exists during SSH connectivity checks.
