## The Translation

You know those notification badges on apps — little red dots that say "Hey, look at me!"? The menu bar icon in Clawdis now has one of those.

But here's the clever part: when you pause Clawdis, the critter icon used to just look... different. Kind of sleepy. Now, if something needs attention (like the relay stopped working), it can show a little warning badge WITHOUT changing how the paused critter looks.

It's like having a sticky note on your sleeping pet's bed — the pet is still asleep (paused), but the note tells you something needs attention.

The code got reorganized a bit too. The critter icon and any badges are now layered on top of each other using a `ZStack`, like stacking transparent sheets. That makes it easy to add badges without messing up the main icon.

## The Changes

Refactors `CritterStatusLabel` to use `ZStack` for overlay composition. Adds relay status property and renders an attention badge for certain relay states. Keeps the paused critter appearance unchanged while still allowing badge overlays.
