## The Translation

Remember that little status light we just added? Well, it was at the very top of the menu, before the toggle switches. That felt a bit awkward — like putting the speedometer before the steering wheel!

This change moves things around so the menu makes more sense:
1. First, the toggle switches (turn things on and off)
2. Then the "Open Chat" button
3. *Then* the status light
4. Finally, the other buttons like Settings and Quit

It's like organizing a remote control so the buttons you use most are in the most natural spots. The menu also got wrapped in a neat container (`VStack`) to keep everything tidy and properly spaced.

## The Changes

Reorganizes the macOS menu content: moves relay status indicator below the toggles and "Open Chat" button instead of at the top. Wraps all menu items in a `VStack` with consistent spacing for better layout control.
