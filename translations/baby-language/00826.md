title: "Timeouts for Health Probes"

## The Translation

Health probes over the control channel could hang forever if something went wrong. Now they have timeouts!

17 lines add timeout handling. If a health probe takes too long, it fails gracefully instead of hanging.

## The Changes

Adds timeout to control health probes in `ControlChannel.swift` (17 lines). Rebuilds webchat bundle.
