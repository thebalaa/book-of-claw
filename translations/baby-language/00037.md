<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00037-a5e2636e17-Add command timeout and async polling auto-replies-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added two important features:

**Command timeout**: Auto-reply commands now have a time limit (configurable, defaults to 30 seconds). If a command takes too long, it gets killed automatically. This prevents the program from hanging forever if your auto-reply command gets stuck.

**Async polling**: In poll mode, auto-replies now happen in the background without blocking the polling loop. The program fires off the auto-reply and immediately continues polling for more messages. It's like sending a letter and not waiting for a response before checking your mailbox again.

The timeout is configurable in your config file - you can set it higher for slow commands or lower for fast ones.

## The Changes

This commit added command timeouts and async replies:

- Added `timeoutSeconds` field to config (defaults to 30)
- Modified `getReplyFromConfig()` to accept timeout parameter and pass it to execFile
- Changed polling loop to call `autoReplyIfConfigured()` without await (fire-and-forget)
- Added timeout enforcement in command execution
- Improved error messages when commands timeout

Auto-replies are now bounded by time limits and don't block polling.
