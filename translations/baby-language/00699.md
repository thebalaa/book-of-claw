title: "Combining Remote Mode Label with Picker"

## The Translation

The "Remote Mode" label was separate from the picker dropdown. That's extra clutter!

This folds the label into the picker itself. 4 lines removed, 1 added — simpler UI!

## The Changes

Folds remote mode label into the picker in `GeneralSettings.swift` (5 lines changed, net -3 lines).
