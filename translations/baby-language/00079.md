<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00079-594fb125e6-test- add infra coverage and fix web logging-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added tests for infrastructure code (logger, retry logic, config validation) and fixed web provider logging to use the new logger system.

More tests mean more confidence that things work correctly!

## The Changes

- Added logger tests
- Added retry backoff tests
- Added config validation tests
- Fixed web provider to use logger
- Improved test coverage

Core infrastructure is now well-tested.
