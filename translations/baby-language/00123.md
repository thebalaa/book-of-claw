## The Translation

Have you ever seen a list that's SO long and spread out that you have to scroll forever to read it all? It's like when someone tells a story but takes five minutes to say something simple.

The README (that's like the instruction manual for the project) had a big table showing all the auto-reply settings. It was correct, but it was really stretched out and took up lots of space.

We made the same table, but more compact — like folding a map so it fits in your pocket. All the same information is still there, it just doesn't waste as much space now.

## The Changes

Reformats the auto-reply parameter table in the README to be more compact. Reduces visual clutter while keeping all the same information accessible.
