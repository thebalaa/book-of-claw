## The Translation

Imagine you're at a friend's house and you brought your own basketball, but then you notice they already have a perfectly good one sitting right there. Why carry your own?

The helper robot was doing something similar — it was trying to install its own special Node toolbox, even though the computer it runs on already HAS Node installed!

We removed seven whole lines of instructions that said "go get Node." Now it just uses whatever Node is already there. Less work, same result. Sometimes the simplest solution is to stop overcomplicating things.

## The Changes

Removes the setup-node action entirely from the CI workflow. The GitHub runner already has Node.js installed, so we just use that directly instead of installing a specific version.
