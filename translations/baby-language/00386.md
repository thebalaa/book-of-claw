title: "Directives Work in Group Batches"

## The Translation

In groups, messages get batched together. But what if one of those messages is just a directive like "/verbose on"?

This fix allows directive-only toggles to work even inside a batch of group messages. The toggle gets processed, then the rest of the batch continues.

## The Changes

Fixes handling of directive-only toggles (like /verbose) inside batched group messages.
