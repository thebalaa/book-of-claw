title: "Better Overlay Colors and Auto-Resize"

## The Translation

The overlay's colors (partial vs final text) weren't preserved correctly. And resizing could be janky.

44 lines fix both:
- Attributed colors stay correct during updates
- Auto-resize works smoothly
- No more color flashing!

## The Changes

Fixes overlay attributed colors and auto-resize in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (58 lines changed, 44 added, 14 removed).
