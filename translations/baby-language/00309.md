## The Translation

TypeScript has a rule: when you're only exporting a type (a description of what something looks like, not actual code), you should use "export type" instead of just "export."

This is a tiny fix to follow that rule. It makes the code cleaner and helps TypeScript do its job better.

It's like using the right grammar—technically the meaning is the same, but it's more correct!

## The Changes

Fixes type-only re-exports to use `export type` syntax as per TypeScript best practices.
