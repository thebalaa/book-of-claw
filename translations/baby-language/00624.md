title: "Matching the Microphone Level Bar Width"

## The Translation

The microphone level bar (that shows how loud your voice is) wasn't quite the same width as other elements. It looked a bit off.

4 lines adjusted to align it properly. Now everything lines up nicely!

## The Changes

Adjusts mic level bar width in `VoiceWakeSettings.swift` (7 lines changed) to align with other UI elements.
