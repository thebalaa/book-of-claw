## The Translation

Verbose mode was showing too much detail! Sometimes you just want to know WHAT tools were used, not every tiny detail about what they returned.

This change shows just the metadata—tool names and basic info—not the full results. Less clutter, still informative.

Like a receipt that shows "bought milk" instead of a full description of the milk.

## The Changes

Changes verbose mode to send only tool result metadata rather than full results, reducing output verbosity while maintaining useful information.
