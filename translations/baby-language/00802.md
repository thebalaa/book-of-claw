## The Translation

When the control channel has issues, you need diagnostics to debug! This adds:
- Connection status indicators
- Tunnel-based testing
- Better error reporting

100 new lines across 6 files make troubleshooting the control channel much easier.

## The Changes

Adds control channel diagnostics to ControlChannel (41 lines), GeneralSettings (55 lines), and supporting files.
