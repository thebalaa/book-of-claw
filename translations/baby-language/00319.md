## The Translation

We fixed the redirect-following code, but how do we know it works? We test it!

This adds test coverage specifically for media downloads that involve redirects. The test pretends to be Twilio saying "go get the file from that other address" and makes sure the code follows correctly.

The changelog also gets updated to note these improvements.

## The Changes

Adds test coverage for media download redirect handling and updates the changelog to document the improvements.
