## The Translation

After breaking something into pieces, you need to make sure each piece still works! That's what this change does.

The builder added tests for the new command-reply code and the new transcription code. Each test pretends to be a real situation: "What if someone sends a voice message? Does it get turned into text correctly?" "What if a command takes a long time? Does it wait patiently?"

There's also a new document that explains why the code was split up. It's like leaving a note that says "Hey future builder, here's why I organized things this way." Future-you (or future-someone-else) will appreciate it!

## The Changes

Adds comprehensive test suites for `command-reply.ts` and `transcription.ts` modules. Creates a refactoring documentation file explaining the auto-reply module split. The command-reply module also receives additional helper functions extracted from tests to improve code organization.
