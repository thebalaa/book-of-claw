## The Translation

The health status display was added, but it wouldn't update until something triggered a refresh. Why wait?

This one-line addition kicks off a health refresh as soon as the app launches. You immediately see the current health status!

## The Changes

Adds 1 line to `MenuBar.swift` to trigger a health refresh at app launch.
