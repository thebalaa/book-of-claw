## The Translation

A big version number bump! Going from 1.x to 2.0.0 means significant changes have happened. All the work on voice wake, RPC, health checks, and the Mac app UI improvements add up to a major new version.

Just one line changes, but it's a celebration of lots of progress!

## The Changes

Bumps version to 2.0.0 in `package.json` (1 line).
