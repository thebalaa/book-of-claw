<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00060-289b417c8e-Pin to -whiskeysockets-baileys 7-0-0-rc-9 and remove auth fallback-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter decided to pin to a specific version of baileys (7.0.0-rc.9) instead of supporting multiple versions. This simplifies the code - no more fallback imports needed.

When you pin a version, you say "always use this exact version" instead of "use the latest." It makes things more predictable but means you have to manually update when you want a newer version.

He removed the auth fallback code since it's no longer needed.

## The Changes

This commit pinned baileys version:

- Updated package.json to require @whiskeysockets/baileys 7.0.0-rc.9 exactly
- Removed import fallback code
- Simplified auth imports to single path
- Updated lockfile with pinned version

Dependencies are now predictable with explicit version pinning.
