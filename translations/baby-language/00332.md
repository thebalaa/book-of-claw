title: "Heartbeats That Return Lists"

## The Translation

Heartbeats can now return multiple messages too! But different parts of the code expected different formats—some wanted a list, some wanted a single item.

This change "normalizes" the format. Everything gets converted to the same shape so there's no confusion. Lists stay as lists, single items get wrapped in a list.

Consistency makes everything work together smoothly!

## The Changes

Normalizes heartbeat reply handling to properly support array responses, ensuring consistent formatting across the auto-reply system.
