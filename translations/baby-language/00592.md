## The Translation

Before building something complex, it helps to write down the plan. RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is how the agent will communicate.

This 56-line document outlines:
- What RPC is and why we need it
- How messages will flow between components
- What commands will be available
- How errors will be handled

It's like an architect's blueprint before building a house. The team can review the plan and make sure everyone agrees before coding.

## The Changes

Adds `docs/rpc.md` (56 lines) documenting the RPC plan for agent CLI communication, including message formats and command structure.
