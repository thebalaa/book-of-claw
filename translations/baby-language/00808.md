title: "Ears Match Overlay State"

## The Translation

The menu bar critter has ear holes when listening. They should match the overlay's visibility!

2 lines sync the ear holes with overlay state. When the overlay is visible (you're speaking), ears are open.

## The Changes

Syncs critter ears with overlay visibility in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (2 lines).
