## The Translation

The new thinking directives need documentation! This change explains what the different thinking levels do.

Maybe "fast" for quick chats, "medium" for normal questions, "deep" for complex problems. The docs help people choose the right level.

The changelog also gets trimmed and cleaned up—some old entries were getting long!

## The Changes

Documents thinking levels in the README and Clawd docs, explaining the different options. Also cleans up and consolidates the changelog.
