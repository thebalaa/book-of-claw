## The Translation

Wait, we just did 0.1.1, and now it's already 0.1.2? That's fast!

Sometimes you release something and immediately notice something that needs fixing. Like sending a letter and realizing you forgot to sign it. Oops! Quick, send another one!

There was an issue with "commander typings" — basically, some labels on our code weren't quite right. We fixed those AND bumped to version 0.1.2. Better to fix things quickly than to leave them broken. That's the beauty of modern software — updates can happen fast!

## The Changes

Bumps version to 0.1.2 and fixes commander typing issues. Adds changelog entry for the new version and corrects type definitions in the CLI code.
