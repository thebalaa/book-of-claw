## The Translation

The web chat had lots of separate JavaScript files that needed to be loaded one by one. This caused problems with module loading and CORS.

Rolldown (a bundler) combines all the code into ONE big file:
- 195,542 lines of bundled JavaScript!
- All dependencies included
- No more module loading issues

Plus bootstrap scripts and stubs for browser compatibility.

## The Changes

Adds Rolldown bundling for web chat assets. Creates `webchat.bundle.js` (195,542 lines), bootstrap scripts, stubs for SDK compatibility, and rolldown config. Major consolidation of web chat resources.
