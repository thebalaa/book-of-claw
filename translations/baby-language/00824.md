title: "Keeping the Control Tunnel Connected"

## The Translation

The remote control tunnel could disconnect and stay disconnected. This keeps it alive!

11 new lines add keep-alive logic so the tunnel reconnects automatically when needed.

## The Changes

Adds keep-alive for remote control tunnel in `ControlChannel.swift` (9 lines) and `GeneralSettings.swift` (4 lines).
