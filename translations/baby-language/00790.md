## The Translation

Voice wake was silent — you had to watch for visual cues. Now it makes sounds!

251 new lines add audio feedback:
- `VoiceWakeChime.swift` (82 lines) — the sound player
- Trigger chime: "I heard you!"
- Send chime: "Sending your command!"
- Even a Star Trek computer sound included!

Delightful audio feedback makes voice wake feel alive!

## The Changes

Adds chime sounds for trigger and send with `VoiceWakeChime.swift`, sound resources, and UI settings across 9 files.
