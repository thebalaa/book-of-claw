## The Translation

The gateway needs more test coverage! 133 new test lines cover:
- Agent sequencing (23 lines)
- Tick watchdog (67 lines in client)
- Presence fingerprint (43 lines in server)

Confidence through testing!

## The Changes

Adds gateway tests for sequencing, watchdog, and presence across client, server, and agent-events.
