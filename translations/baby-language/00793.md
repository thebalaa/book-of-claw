## The Translation

The overlay needed more control! Now you get:
- A close button (hover to see it)
- Overlay stays until you escape or send
- Edit mode improvements

134 lines added, 73 removed. Major UX improvement for controlling the overlay!

## The Changes

Adds hover close button and keeps overlay until explicit dismiss in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (207 lines changed).
