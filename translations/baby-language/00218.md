## The Translation

Remember that note explaining why the code was split up? Turns out it was just a temporary note for the builder, not something that needed to live in the project forever.

It's like when you leave yourself a reminder note while doing homework, then throw it away once you're done. The note served its purpose!

The refactoring is finished and understood, so the explanation file can go away. The code itself is the documentation now.

## The Changes

Removes the temporary refactoring documentation file that was created during the auto-reply module split. The reorganization is complete and the documentation is no longer needed.
