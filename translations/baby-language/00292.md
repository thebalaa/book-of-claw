## The Translation

Sometimes heartbeats would try to run while the system was already handling another message. That's like someone tapping your shoulder while you're carrying a heavy box—not the best timing!

Now heartbeats check if the system is "busy" first. If it is, the heartbeat waits or skips. The session test fixtures also got better isolation.

Respect when someone's in the middle of something!

## The Changes

Adds busy-checking logic to skip heartbeats when the system is already processing messages. Improves test fixtures with better session isolation.
