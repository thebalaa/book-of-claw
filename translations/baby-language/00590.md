title: "Making the Agent Actually Send Messages"

## The Translation

The XPC (inter-process communication) for agent sends wasn't working properly. When you asked the agent to send a message, nothing happened!

The fix makes XPC call the CLI agent properly:
- Instead of trying to handle it internally, it invokes the CLI
- The CLI knows how to actually send messages
- Errors are properly caught and reported

54 new lines make the agent send feature actually work!

## The Changes

Fixes agent XPC in `XPCService.swift` (54 new lines) by properly invoking the CLI agent process to handle send requests.
