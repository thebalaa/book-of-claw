## The Translation

CLAWDIS gets a Mac companion app! 🖥️ Now you can run it as a proper Mac application with a menu bar icon and everything.

The app lives in the `apps/macos` folder and even has a custom lobster icon! 🦞

This makes the project much more accessible to Mac users.

## The Changes

Adds macOS companion app with SwiftUI interface, custom menu bar icon, and bundled assets.
