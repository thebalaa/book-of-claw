title: "Simpler Health Status in the Menu"

## The Translation

The health status in the menu was showing too much detail. Most of the time you just want to know: is everything okay?

This simplifies the messaging. 2 lines added to HealthStore, 1 removed from MenuBar. Cleaner, easier to understand at a glance.

## The Changes

Simplifies health status display in `HealthStore.swift` (2 lines) and `MenuBar.swift` (1 line removed) for clearer messaging.
