title: "Single Source for Working State"

## The Translation

"Working" state was computed from multiple sources — confusing! Now it comes from one place: agent events.

73 lines removed, 28 added:
- Remove duplicate tracking
- Use agent events as the source
- Add tests

Single source of truth!

## The Changes

Single-sources working state from agent events. Removes duplicates from AgentRPC, CLI. Adds tests.
