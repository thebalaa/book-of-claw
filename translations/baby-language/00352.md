## The Translation

File paths can be long: `/home/username/documents/projects/stuff/file.txt`. That's a lot to read!

This change shortens home paths. Instead of that long path, you might see `~/documents/projects/stuff/file.txt`. The tilde (~) means "home folder."

Shorter paths are easier to read and take less space!

## The Changes

Shortens home directory paths in verbose tool metadata by replacing the full home path with `~`.
