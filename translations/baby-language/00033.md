<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00033-a566ba442b-Fix webhook update- send form fields via request- keep SDK-phone fallbacks-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter improved the webhook update system to try three different methods, in order:

**Method 1** (new): Use a raw API request with explicit form fields. This is the most direct way to update a WhatsApp sender's callback URL. It uses PascalCase field names (`CallbackUrl`, `CallbackMethod`) which the raw API expects.

**Method 2**: Use the SDK helper with camelCase fields (`callbackUrl`, `callbackMethod`). This is what the previous commit tried, but it doesn't always work.

**Method 3**: Fall back to updating the phone number's SMS webhook instead.

Now the program tries method 1 first (the most reliable), then 2, then 3. Only if all three fail does it give up.

It's like having three different keys for the same lock - try the main key, then the spare, then call a locksmith.

## The Changes

This commit reordered webhook update methods and added a raw request approach:

- Added raw `request()` call as Method 1 with PascalCase form fields
- Moved SDK helper call to Method 2 with camelCase fields
- Kept phone number fallback as Method 3
- Each method has comments explaining when it's tried
- If verbose, logs which method failed before trying the next

This makes webhook updates more robust across different Twilio account configurations.
