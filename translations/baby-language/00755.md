## The Translation

Speaking patterns are interesting:
- Before speech: you might pause to think (5 seconds ok!)
- After speech: you're probably done (2 seconds enough!)

5 new lines implement different silence thresholds for before and after speech begins.

## The Changes

Updates `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (6 lines) to use 5s silence before speech, 2s after.
