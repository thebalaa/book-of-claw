## The Translation

Imagine your classroom got renamed from "Room 101" to "Room A." You'd need to go around and change all the old signs that still say "Room 101"!

The relay service used to be called "warelay" with a label like `com.steipete.warelay`. But it was renamed to "clawdis" with the label `com.steipete.clawdis`. Some old documents and code still mentioned the old "warelay" name.

This commit goes through and cleans up those leftover references:
- Updates the docs to only mention the new name
- Removes mentions of the "legacy" old label
- Fixes a small code issue where an unnecessary `Task` wrapper was used

It's like erasing "Room 101" from everywhere and writing "Room A" so nobody gets confused.

## The Changes

Removes legacy "warelay" label references from documentation. Updates AGENTS.md to only reference `com.steipete.clawdis`. Cleans up CHANGELOG.md. Simplifies `PermissionsSettings.swift` by removing an unnecessary `Task` wrapper around an already-async call.
