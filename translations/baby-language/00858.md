## The Translation

See all running Clawdis instances! A new tab shows:
- Active instances
- Their status (presence beacons)
- When they last reported

274 new lines:
- `InstancesSettings.swift` (80 lines) — the UI
- `InstancesStore.swift` (82 lines) — data management
- `PresenceReporter.swift` (95 lines) — sends beacons

Multi-instance awareness!
