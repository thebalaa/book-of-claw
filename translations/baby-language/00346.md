title: "Streaming Tool Results"

## The Translation

Instead of waiting until the AI is completely done, you can now see tool results as they happen! This uses "streaming" via tau rpc.

It's like watching a cooking show live versus watching a recording. You see each step as it happens, not just the final dish.

Streaming makes waiting feel shorter because you're seeing progress!

## The Changes

Implements streaming of verbose tool results through tau rpc, showing tool outputs in real-time as the AI uses them.
