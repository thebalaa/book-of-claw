## The Translation

The "Clawdis active" toggle was buried in the middle of settings. But it's the most important control — should be at the top!

2 lines move it to where users will find it first.

## The Changes

Moves Clawdis active toggle to the top of `GeneralSettings.swift` (4 lines changed).
