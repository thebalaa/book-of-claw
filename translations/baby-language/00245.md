title: "Testing the Session Override"

## The Translation

We added the ability to override which session a heartbeat uses. Now let's make sure it actually works!

This change adds a test that says: "I'm going to set a specific session-id override. When the heartbeat runs, it better use THAT session, not make something up."

The code also gets the logic to actually honor that override. So now both the feature AND the test for the feature are in place.

Trust, but verify! The test keeps us honest.

## The Changes

Implements the session-id override logic in the auto-reply module and adds comprehensive tests verifying that heartbeats correctly use the overridden session-id when provided instead of the default session resolution.
