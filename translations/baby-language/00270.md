## The Translation

The heartbeat feature keeps getting better! This change expands the documentation to show everything heartbeats can do.

Check your inbox periodically? Heartbeat can do that. Send daily summaries? Heartbeat. Keep connections alive? Also heartbeat!

The docs now paint a fuller picture of this powerful feature.

## The Changes

Expands the heartbeat capabilities documentation with additional use cases, examples, and configuration options.
