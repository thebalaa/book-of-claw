<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00046-657188a7e2-Add vitest and unit coverage for provider helpers-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added automated tests to the project! Before, there were no tests - you had to manually check if things worked. Now there are tests that automatically verify the code works correctly.

He chose vitest (a modern testing tool) and wrote tests for the provider helper functions. Tests check things like "does the provider detection work?" and "do the helper functions return the right values?"

It's like adding a quality control inspector to a factory. The inspector (tests) checks that each part works before the whole product ships.

## The Changes

This commit added vitest testing infrastructure:

- Added vitest dev dependency and configuration
- Wrote unit tests for provider helper functions
- Added coverage reporting
- Created npm scripts for running tests
- Set up test file structure

The codebase now has automated quality assurance through testing.
