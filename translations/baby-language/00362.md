## The Translation

The tau RPC code for detecting when the AI finishes was complicated. This change simplifies it!

Now it just waits for either "agent_end" (normal finish) or "exit" (the process ended). Two clear conditions, much simpler code.

Sometimes removing code is better than adding it!

## The Changes

Simplifies tau RPC completion logic to resolve on either agent_end or process exit, significantly reducing code complexity.
