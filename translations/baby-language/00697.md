title: "Remote Test Finds CLI Again"

## The Translation

The remote test was broken — it couldn't find the CLI because it wasn't using the path discovery system. Oops!

3 lines fix this by making the remote test use the same CLI path discovery as everything else.

## The Changes

Fixes remote test to use CLI path discovery in `Utilities.swift` (3 lines) and adds a test (1 line).
