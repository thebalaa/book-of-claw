## The Translation

Remember the code that handles pictures — hosting them, storing them, serving them up? We should probably make sure that all works, right?

We added 205 lines of tests just for the media (picture) handling! Three new test files:
- `host.test.ts` — Does hosting pictures work? (93 lines)
- `server.test.ts` — Does the picture server respond correctly? (52 lines)  
- `store.test.ts` — Does saving and retrieving pictures work? (60 lines)

It's like testing every drawer in a filing cabinet. Open, close, put stuff in, take stuff out. Now we KNOW the picture system works properly!

## The Changes

Adds comprehensive test coverage for media handling with three new test files. Tests cover media hosting, the media server, and the media store functionality.
