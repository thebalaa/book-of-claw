title: "Blinking When Nothing is Sent"

## The Translation

If you trigger voice wake but don't say anything, the overlay dismisses empty. What happens? The critter blinks!

20 new lines add this cute feedback:
- Track when overlay dismisses empty
- Make the critter blink
- Visual acknowledgment that nothing was sent

## The Changes

Adds critter blink when overlay dismisses empty across AppState (5 lines), MenuBar (21 lines), and overlay (3 lines).
