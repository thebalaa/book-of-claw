## The Translation

Have you seen those little badges on Scout uniforms? Each one shows something the Scout accomplished. "Swimming!" "Camping!" "First Aid!"

Open source projects have badges too! Little images that show:
- 🟢 CI passing (our tests work!)
- 📦 npm version (what version is available)
- 📜 License (how you can use this code)

We added three of these shiny badges to our README. Now when someone visits, they immediately see: tests passing, version info, and license. It's professional AND informative!

## The Changes

Adds CI status, npm version, and license badges to the README. Provides at-a-glance project health and metadata information.
