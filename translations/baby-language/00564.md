## The Translation

When different programs need to talk to each other on a Mac, they can use "Mach services" — special secure channels set up by the system.

This commit makes the communication between Clawdis components more secure and reliable:

1. **Secure XPC** — The inter-process communication is now properly secured
2. **Mach service registration** — The system knows about our communication channel
3. **launchd handles it** — The system service manager sets everything up

It's like setting up a proper phone line with the phone company instead of using tin cans and string. More official, more reliable, more secure!

## The Changes

Adds secure XPC setup and Mach service registration via launchd. 61 new lines in MenuBar, 37 in restart-mac.sh. Removes 3 lines from package script that are now handled differently.
