## The Translation

The remote connection UI was duplicated between onboarding and General settings. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) says: make it reusable!

This refactors General settings to reuse the compact remote card, and hides the voice wake forwarder when not needed. 59 lines added, 43 removed — cleaner code!

## The Changes

Refactors `GeneralSettings.swift` (102 lines changed) to reuse compact remote card and conditionally hide voice wake forwarder.
