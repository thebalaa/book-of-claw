## The Translation

The voice wake overlay had a helper for NSAttributedString. It's useful elsewhere too — extract it!

New file `NSAttributedString+VoiceWake.swift` (9 lines) contains the helper. 8 lines removed from overlay.

## The Changes

Extracts attributed string helper to `NSAttributedString+VoiceWake.swift` (9 lines) from VoiceWakeOverlay.
