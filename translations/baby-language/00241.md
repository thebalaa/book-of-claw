## The Translation

Sometimes you want a heartbeat to check on ALL your conversations, not just one. There's a flag called `--all` that does exactly that!

This change adds an example showing how to use it. It's like adding a picture to the instructions that shows: "Press this button to water ALL your plants, not just one."

The code also got a bit smarter about handling the "all" case, making sure it loops through everyone properly.

## The Changes

Adds documentation showing the `--all` heartbeat flag usage and improves the auto-reply code to better handle broadcasting heartbeats to all active sessions rather than a single recipient.
