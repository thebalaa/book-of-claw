## The Translation

The previous auto-start approach was reverted, but we still need a solution. This commit takes a different approach!

Agent messages now go through RPC and voice forwarding properly:
- RPC is used for local delivery
- Voice forwarding works for remote delivery
- Health checks are improved too

105 new lines, 45 removed. A more robust solution across 11 files!

## The Changes

Refactors agent delivery to use RPC and voice forwarding. Updates AgentRPC, XPCService, CLI, IPC protocol, and health commands. 105 lines added, 45 removed across 11 files.
