title: "Breaking Long Replies into Chunks"

## The Translation

WhatsApp and Twilio have limits on how long a single message can be. What if the AI writes a really long reply?

This change adds "chunking"—breaking long replies into smaller pieces that fit within the limits. It's like cutting a large pizza into slices so everyone can eat!

The reply gets split at sensible points (paragraphs, sentences) so it still reads naturally.

## The Changes

Implements reply chunking for Twilio and Web providers to split long responses that exceed platform message limits into multiple smaller messages.
