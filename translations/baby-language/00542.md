## The Translation

Oops! The `--version` command was added, but it wasn't showing the *real* version number. It was probably just showing a placeholder or nothing useful.

The real version lives in a special file called `Info.plist` inside the app bundle. It's like the app's birth certificate with all its official information.

This fix teaches the CLI tool to:
1. Find the main Clawdis app bundle
2. Open its Info.plist file
3. Read the `CFBundleShortVersionString` (fancy name for "version number")
4. Display that to the user

The packaging script also got updated to make sure the version is properly written to the plist file during builds. Now `clawdis --version` shows the actual version!

## The Changes

Fixes `--version` in ClawdisCLI to read the version from the main app's `Info.plist` file. Adds 33 lines with plist reading logic. Updates `package-mac-app.sh` to ensure version info is properly set during packaging.
