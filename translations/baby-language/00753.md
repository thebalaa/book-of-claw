title: "Longer Hard Stop for Voice Capture"

## The Translation

What if you're dictating a long message? The voice capture had a hard stop that was too short. Now it's 120 seconds — 2 full minutes!

That's enough time for substantial voice input while still having a reasonable limit.

## The Changes

Extends voice capture hard stop to 120 seconds in `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (3 lines changed).
