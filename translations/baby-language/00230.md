## The Translation

Here's a problem: when a heartbeat fires, who should the response go to? There's no incoming message, so there's no obvious recipient!

The fix is clever: remember the last person we were chatting with! If a heartbeat triggers and needs to send something, it looks up "who did we talk to most recently?" and sends to them.

It's like if you're thinking out loud and realize you need to tell someone something—you'd probably tell the friend you were just talking to, not a random stranger.

This makes heartbeat responses actually useful instead of getting lost in space.

## The Changes

Fixes heartbeat-triggered responses to fall back to the last session contact when no explicit recipient is available. This ensures heartbeat-initiated messages have a valid destination by using the most recent conversation partner.
