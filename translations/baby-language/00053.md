<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00053-9b4dceecfe-Add web provider inbound monitor with auto-replies-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added inbound message monitoring for the WhatsApp Web provider. Now the web provider can listen for incoming messages and trigger auto-replies, just like the Twilio provider.

Before, the web provider could only send messages. Now it's feature-complete: it can receive messages, display them, and automatically reply based on your configuration.

It's like upgrading from a one-way radio (transmit only) to a two-way radio (send and receive).

## The Changes

This commit added web provider message monitoring:

- Implemented inbound message listener for baileys client
- Added auto-reply support for web provider
- Created event handlers for incoming WhatsApp messages
- Integrated config-driven auto-reply system
- Displays incoming messages with sender info

Web provider now has full bidirectional messaging with auto-reply support.
