<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00085-d7cc94333a-chore- logger cleanup and test fixes-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter cleaned up the logger implementation, fixed test issues related to logging, and ensured all tests pass with the new logging system.

When you change core infrastructure like logging, you have to update all the tests that depend on it.

## The Changes

- Cleaned up logger code
- Fixed tests broken by logger changes
- Improved logger API
- Ensured test suite is green

Logger is now clean and all tests pass.
