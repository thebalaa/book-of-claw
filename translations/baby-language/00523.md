## The Translation

Imagine asking your friend to bake a cake, but you don't tell them which kitchen to use. They might end up in a kitchen without any ingredients!

When the relay program starts, it needs to be in the right folder — the Clawdis project folder where all its files live. Before, the app would pass `--dir` to tell pnpm where to look, but the actual program still started in a different folder.

Now, the relay starts with its "working directory" set to the project root. It's like saying "Go stand in the kitchen, THEN start baking." The relay can find all its files because it's already in the right place.

The log message now shows you where it's starting from, too: `(cwd: /path/to/project)`. Helpful for debugging!

## The Changes

Sets the `workingDirectory` parameter when spawning the relay process to the configured project root path. Removes the `--dir` flag from pnpm since cwd handles it now. Adds cwd to the startup log message for debugging. Imports `System` (or `SystemPackage`) for `FilePath` type.
