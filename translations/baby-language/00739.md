## The Translation

The voice wake overlay looked good, but the animations could be smoother! More polish on the visual experience:
- Better fade transitions
- Smoother timing
- More satisfying feel

57 lines added, 13 removed. The overlay now feels more polished and professional!

## The Changes

Refines voice wake overlay animations in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (70 lines changed, 57 added, 13 removed).
