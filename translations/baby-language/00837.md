title: "Don't Crash When Port is Busy"

## The Translation

If the webchat port (like 3000) is already in use, the relay would crash! Not good.

8 lines handle the busy port gracefully — log a warning instead of crashing. Much more robust!

## The Changes

Handles busy webchat port gracefully in `server.ts` (8 lines). Rebuilds webchat bundle.
