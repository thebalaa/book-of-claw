title: "Per-Notification Sounds Instead"

## The Translation

The default sound picker in the UI was removed! Why? Because the CLI handles sounds on a per-notification basis instead.

This is more flexible — different notifications can have different sounds. 20 lines removed, 4 added (docs update).

## The Changes

Removes default sound picker from AppState and GeneralSettings (17 lines removed), updates XPCService (1 line), and documentation.
