## The Translation

Remember that special window (tmux) we made for watching the relay? Well, it was starting up in the background — like turning on a TV in another room. You'd have to walk over there to see it.

Now when you start the relay window, you automatically jump INTO it! It's like the TV turns on and you're suddenly sitting right in front of it with the remote in your hand.

This makes it much easier to see what's happening right away, instead of having to go find the window yourself.

## The Changes

Updates the relay:tmux command to automatically attach to the session after starting it. Adds logic to join an existing session rather than leaving it running in the background.
