## The Translation

When you add new features, you should tell people about them! The changelog (that project diary) gets updated with news about the heartbeat and reconnection features.

Also, the command-line tool now shows you what settings it's using when you start up. Instead of running silently, it says "Hey, I'm using these settings: heartbeat every 30 seconds, will retry 5 times..." 

It's like a pilot reading their checklist before takeoff. Everyone knows what's configured and nothing is a mystery.

## The Changes

Updates the changelog with entries for the new web relay features. Enhances the CLI startup to display active relay settings (heartbeat interval, reconnect limits, etc.) so users can verify their configuration at a glance.
