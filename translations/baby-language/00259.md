## The Translation

Here's a helpful note: if you already have a Claude subscription, Claude Code (the command-line version) uses that same subscription! You don't need to pay twice.

This change adds that clarification to the docs so people don't get confused about billing. Nobody wants to pay for the same thing twice!

## The Changes

Updates documentation to clarify that Claude Code reuses an existing Claude subscription rather than requiring a separate payment.
