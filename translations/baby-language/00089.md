<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00089-ca0b50d772-chore- align web provider logging and relay e2e-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter updated the web provider to use the logger consistently. Now both providers (Twilio and Web) use the same logging system with the same formatting.

He also improved the relay end-to-end flow.

## The Changes

- Migrated web provider to logger
- Aligned logging format across providers
- Improved relay command flow
- Consistent logging everywhere

Both providers now have unified, consistent logging.
