## The Translation

Remember how the project used to be called "warelay" in some places? This massive cleanup goes through EVERYTHING and replaces the old names with "clawdis":

- 26 files touched!
- Changelogs, docs, tests, code — all updated
- Every mention of "warelay" becomes "clawdis"

It's like going through your entire house and replacing every old "Jones" name tag with "Smith" after a name change. Thorough and complete!

Now there's no confusion — it's Clawdis everywhere.

## The Changes

Purges all remaining "warelay" references across 26 files. Updates CHANGELOG, RelayProcessManager, SessionData, docs, and multiple test files. Cleans up package.json scripts. Net reduction of 10 lines while standardizing naming.
