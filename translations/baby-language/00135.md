## The Translation

When you meet someone new, what's the first thing you do? You introduce yourself! "Hi, I'm Sarah. Nice to meet you!"

Claude (the AI brain) was answering messages but didn't really know WHO it was supposed to be. It was just... Claude. Generic.

Now we add a little introduction at the start of every conversation: "You are Clawd..." This tells the AI its name, its identity, how it should behave. It's like giving someone a name tag and a job description before they start working.

## The Changes

Adds a Clawd identity prefix to the Claude prompt. Prepends context about the assistant's name and role before processing each message.
