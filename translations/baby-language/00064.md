<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00064-b76ed7e2bb-Add lint-fix to run biome check-format-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a `lint-fix` command that runs both linting and formatting in one go. Before you had to run lint and format separately.

Now `pnpm lint-fix` checks your code style AND fixes formatting issues at the same time. It's more convenient for developers.

## The Changes

This commit added combined lint-fix command:

- Created lint-fix npm script
- Runs biome check --write (includes both linting and formatting)
- Simplified developer workflow
- One command to fix all style issues

Developers can now fix all code style issues with a single command.
