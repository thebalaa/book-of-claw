## The Translation

Have you ever lost something and wished you'd written down where you last saw it? Detectives keep notebooks for exactly this reason — so they can trace their steps!

We were having trouble figuring out where picture addresses were going wrong. Were they being found? Were they being parsed correctly? It was a mystery!

So we added logging — a detective's notebook for the code. Now it writes down: "I found these MEDIA tokens..." and "I extracted this from Claude's response..." 

When something goes wrong, we can read the notes and solve the mystery!

## The Changes

Adds debug logging to MEDIA extraction and parsing. Logs Claude's raw text response and the extracted media tokens to help diagnose issues when images aren't appearing correctly.
