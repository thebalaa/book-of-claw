## The Translation

Voice wake and push-to-talk both manage voice sessions. Let's centralize that!

New `VoiceSessionCoordinator.swift` (137 lines!) manages all voice sessions:
- Prevents conflicts
- Coordinates between wake and PTT
- Cleaner architecture

168 new lines, 39 removed.

## The Changes

Adds VoiceSessionCoordinator (137 lines) to centralize voice sessions for wake and PTT.
