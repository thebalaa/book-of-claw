## The Translation

When things aren't lined up, it looks messy. Like when your crayons are all different heights in the box.

The microphone and audio level rows in Voice Wake settings weren't quite aligned. This fix adjusts the layout so they line up nicely — same spacing, same alignment. The settings panel looks tidier now!

## The Changes

Adjusts layout in `VoiceWakeSettings.swift` (22 lines changed, 13 added, 9 removed) to align the microphone and audio level rows consistently.
