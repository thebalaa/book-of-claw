title: "A Test Button for Voice Forwarding"

## The Translation

Voice forwarding is complex — it involves SSH, remote commands, and timing. Testing it manually is tedious.

This adds a "Test Voice Forward" button in Debug settings! Click it, and it simulates a voice forward without needing to actually speak. Great for debugging the pipeline.

52 new lines in DebugSettings, 17 net new in the forwarder. Developers can now easily test the forwarding path!

## The Changes

Adds voice forward test button to `DebugSettings.swift` (52 lines). Updates `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` (26 lines changed) to support test invocation.
