## The Translation

The AI can use a web browser now! This change documents browser-tools CLI—a way to control a browser from the command line.

There are also example tweets showing what kinds of things you can do. Maybe the AI posts updates automatically, or reads your timeline. The examples spark ideas!

It's exciting to see what's possible when an AI can browse the web.

## The Changes

Adds documentation for browser-tools CLI integration and includes example use cases demonstrating tweet-related automation possibilities.
