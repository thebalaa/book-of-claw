<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00061-66359736d3-Update to latest Baileys RC and clean imports-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter updated to the newest release candidate of Baileys and cleaned up how modules are imported. Sometimes new versions change how you import things, so he fixed all the import statements to match the new structure.

It's like updating your contacts when someone changes their phone number - you need to update everywhere you saved the old number.

## The Changes

This commit updated Baileys and cleaned imports:

- Updated @whiskeysockets/baileys to latest RC version
- Fixed import paths to match new package structure
- Removed deprecated imports
- Cleaned up unused dependencies

The project now uses the latest Baileys with corrected imports throughout.
