title: "Telling macOS We Need the Microphone"

## The Translation

When you sign an app, you can include a permission slip that says "this app needs to use the microphone." This is called an "entitlement."

The signing helper script was missing this permission slip! Without it, the voice wake feature (where you say "Hey Clawdis!") wouldn't work properly because macOS wouldn't know the app should be allowed to use the mic.

This tiny fix adds the microphone entitlement to the codesigning script. Now when the app is signed, it properly declares "I need microphone access, please!" and macOS will ask the user for permission.

## The Changes

Adds the microphone (`com.apple.security.device.audio-input`) entitlement to `scripts/codesign-mac-app.sh` so the signed app can request microphone access for voice wake functionality.
