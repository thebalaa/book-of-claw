title: "SSH Output in Health Failures"

## The Translation

When health probes over SSH fail, the raw SSH output contains valuable debug information. Now it's surfaced!

- HealthStore shows SSH output in failure messages (45 lines changed)
- New tests verify the decoding (35 lines)

69 new lines make debugging remote health checks much easier!

## The Changes

Updates `HealthStore.swift` (45 lines) to surface SSH output on failure. Adds `HealthDecodeTests.swift` (35 lines).
