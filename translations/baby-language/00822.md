title: "Tracking Push-to-Talk Listening State"

## The Translation

Push-to-talk needs to know if voice wake is currently listening. This adds state tracking!

7 lines track the listening state so PTT can coordinate properly with voice wake.

## The Changes

Adds listening state tracking for PTT in `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (8 lines changed, 7 added).
