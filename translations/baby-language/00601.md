## The Translation

How do you know if your app is healthy? You check its vital signs! This adds a "health probe" command to the CLI.

Running `clawdis health` checks:
- Is the relay running?
- Is WhatsApp connected?
- Are sessions working?
- Any errors?

It's 277 lines of new code including a health check system, tests, and documentation. Now you can quickly diagnose problems!

## The Changes

Adds health probe command with `src/commands/health.ts` (146 lines), tests (62 lines), CLI integration (24 lines), and documentation (45 lines total).
