## The Translation

Imagine you're telling a long story to your friend. Every single time they ask a question, you start from the very beginning: "Once upon a time, there was a princess..." That would be exhausting and silly, right?

Before this change, the computer was doing exactly that. Every time someone sent a message, it would send the entire introduction again—all the instructions, all the rules, everything from scratch. Like saying your full name, address, and birthday every time you answer the phone!

Now the computer is smarter. It remembers: "Oh, I already told them the rules when we started talking. I don't need to repeat myself." It keeps a little note that says "system sent = yes" so it knows to skip the big introduction on follow-up messages.

It's like how your teacher only explains the classroom rules on the first day of school, not every single morning.

## The Changes

Adds a `sendSystemOnce` setting for sessions that prevents re-sending the system prompt on every message. When enabled, the session store tracks a `systemSent` flag. On the first message, the full prompt (bodyPrefix + sessionIntro) is included. On subsequent messages in the same session, only the user's message goes through. This reduces token usage and speeds up responses for long conversations.
