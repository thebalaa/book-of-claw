title: "Actually Including the Chat Window Files"

## The Translation

Oops! The web chat has all its HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, but they weren't being included when the app was packaged. It's like packing your suitcase but forgetting to put clothes in it!

This 3-line fix updates the packaging script to copy the WebChat resources into the app bundle. Now when you build the app, all the chat window files come with it.

Without this fix, the chat window would just show a blank page because it couldn't find its files!

## The Changes

Adds 3 lines to `scripts/package-mac-app.sh` to copy the WebChat resource files into the app bundle during packaging.
