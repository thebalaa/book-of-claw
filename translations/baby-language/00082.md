<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00082-b3511e1192-docs- note dry-run and config validation-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter updated the documentation to explain the new dry-run feature and config validation. Users now know they can test sends without actually sending and that the program validates their config on startup.

Documentation keeping pace with features!

## The Changes

- Added dry-run docs to README
- Explained config validation behavior
- Added examples of both features
- Updated command help text

Users now know about dry-run and validation features.
