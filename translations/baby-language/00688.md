title: "Showing Error Details in Health Failures"

## The Translation

When health checks fail, the error message was generic. But the actual error details (stderr) contain useful information!

5 new lines surface the stderr output in the health failure text. Now you can see WHY it failed, not just that it failed.

## The Changes

Updates `HealthStore.swift` (7 lines changed) to include stderr content in health failure messages.
