## The Translation

Have you ever seen a door in a building that doesn't go anywhere? "Well, we used to need that door, but now we don't." Time to brick it up!

There was a command called `web:login` that was just an alias — another name for something else. But it was confusing. Why have two names for the same thing?

We removed it! Now there's just ONE way to do the thing, which is simpler. We also made the web quickstart instructions easier to follow. Less is more — when there are fewer confusing options, everything makes more sense.

## The Changes

Removes the redundant `web:login` CLI alias and simplifies the web quickstart documentation. Reduces confusion by having a single, clear path for users to follow.
