## The Translation

When you say "Hey Clawdis" (or whatever your trigger phrase is), the system needs to recognize it correctly. But does it?

These tests check the trigger matching:
- "Hey Clawdis" should match ✓
- "Hey Claude" should match (if configured) ✓
- "Hello world" should NOT match ✗

The tests make sure the listener correctly identifies trigger phrases in the transcribed audio. No false positives, no missed triggers!

## The Changes

Adds 20 lines of trigger matching tests in `VoiceWakeRuntimeTests.swift`. Adds 6 lines to the runtime to expose matching for testing.
