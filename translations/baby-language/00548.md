## The Translation

Before you send a letter, you might want to check that the mailbox actually exists and the address is right. Same with SSH connections!

This commit adds a "connectivity check" button to the Voice Wake settings. When you click it, the app tries to connect to your SSH target and reports back:
- ✅ "Connection successful!" — Great, everything is working
- ❌ "Connection failed: reason" — Something's wrong, here's why

You don't have to wait until you try to use voice commands to find out your SSH setup is broken. You can test it ahead of time!

The UI shows a nice status indicator so you know immediately if your remote computer is reachable.

## The Changes

Adds SSH connectivity check UI to `VoiceWakeSettings` (60 lines). Creates a test connection method in `VoiceWakeForwarder` (50 lines). Shows connection status with success/failure indicators.
