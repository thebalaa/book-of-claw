## The Translation

Peter started a brand new toy box (the project). But he didn't put any toys in it yet.

Instead, he put in a special note called the LICENSE. Think of it like a permission slip. The note says: "Anyone can play with these toys. You can take them home, change them, share them with friends. Just keep this note with the toys so everyone knows the rules."

The note uses something called the MIT License. That's like saying "share and share alike" - everyone is welcome.

That's it! No code, no programs, no files - just the permission slip. Everything else comes later.

## The Changes

The initial commit by Peter Steinberger on November 24, 2025 created the repository with a single file: `LICENSE`. This file contains the MIT License, which lets anyone use, copy, change, and share the software for free. The only rule is you have to include the license notice when you share it. No actual code was added yet - this commit just set up the legal rules for the project.
