## The Translation

When someone is talking to you, it's rude to stop listening before they finish! The voice wake system had this problem — it might stop listening too soon.

This improvement makes Voice Wake:
1. **Keep listening until silence** — Wait for you to actually stop talking before processing
2. **Check permissions first** — Don't let you enable voice wake unless you've granted microphone access

The permission check is important: why show a broken feature? Now the toggle is disabled (grayed out) until you grant mic access. And once enabled, it listens properly until you're done speaking.

## The Changes

Updates Voice Wake to continue listening until detecting silence (rather than stopping at a fixed time). Adds permission gating: the enable toggle is disabled until microphone permission is granted. Changes across AppState, MenuBar, PermissionManager, and VoiceWakeSettings (88 lines total).
