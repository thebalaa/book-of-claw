## The Translation

Time to start a new chapter! The builder changes the changelog to say "we're now working on version 1.2.0."

All the heartbeat features and improvements have been so significant that they deserve a minor version bump. 1.1 is done; now we're building toward 1.2!

The CLI also gets a tiny enhancement to show version info better. Every new chapter deserves a fresh page.

## The Changes

Updates the changelog to open an unreleased 1.2.0 section for ongoing development. Adds version display improvements to the CLI program.
