title: "Removing an Unnecessary Header"

## The Translation

Imagine a chapter in a book that starts with a big title saying "CHAPTER 5: THINGS ABOUT STUFF" but then everything in the chapter is already obviously about things and stuff. The title is just taking up space!

The Tools settings screen had a header that said something like "Tools & MCP" at the top. But since you're already in the Tools settings tab... you know you're looking at tools! The header was redundant.

This commit removes those 4 lines that displayed the unnecessary header. The screen looks cleaner now without the extra label telling you what you already know.

## The Changes

Removes the "Tools & MCP" header section (4 lines) from `ToolsSettings.swift`. The tab title already indicates the section, making the in-page header redundant.
