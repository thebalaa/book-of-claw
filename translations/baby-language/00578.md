title: "Checking if the Helper is Installed"

## The Translation

The CLI helper (the command-line tool) can be installed in `/usr/local/bin`. But is it actually there? Before, you had to check manually.

Now the General Settings shows whether the CLI helper is installed! It checks the filesystem and displays:
- ✅ "Installed" if the helper is found
- ❌ "Not installed" if it's missing (with an install button)

This makes it easy to see at a glance if your setup is complete.

## The Changes

Adds CLI helper detection to `GeneralSettings.swift` (43 lines) with status display. Adds helper function to `Utilities.swift` (23 lines) to check if the CLI is installed.
