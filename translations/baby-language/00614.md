## The Translation

When forwarding voice commands over SSH, the timeout was too short. If your network was slow or the remote machine took a moment, it would give up too quickly!

This raises the timeout from 5 seconds to 30 seconds. Now slow connections have time to work. Patient is polite!

## The Changes

Updates `Constants.swift` and `GeneralSettings.swift` (20 lines) to raise voice wake forward timeout to 30 seconds.
