## The Translation

Remember the tmux helpers that managed sessions in terminal multiplexer? They're no longer needed! The architecture has changed.

Big cleanup:
- Delete `relay_tmux.ts` (50 lines)
- Delete `relay_tmux.test.ts` (47 lines)
- Delete `docs/tmux.md`
- Simplify CLI program (103 lines → much smaller)

229 lines removed, 23 added. Simpler codebase!

## The Changes

Removes tmux helpers from CLI, tests, and docs. Updates help copy. 229 lines deleted across 9 files.
