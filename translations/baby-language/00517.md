## The Translation

When you figure out how to do something tricky, it's smart to write it down so you (and others) can remember later!

The team just solved a confusing problem — why did Mac keep forgetting that Clawdis had permission to use the microphone and screen? The answer involved bundle IDs and code signing. But if nobody wrote it down, the next person would have to figure it all out again.

So this commit adds a little instruction manual. It explains:
- Why the app needs a stable bundle ID
- How the signing works
- What to do if you need a different ID (like for a release build)

It's like leaving a note that says "Here's why we did this and how to change it if you need to."

## The Changes

Adds `docs/mac/signing.md` documenting the debug build signing approach: stable bundle identifier, ad-hoc signing, and how TCC permissions work. Explains the "why" (permissions tied to bundle ID + signature) and "how" (run the script, optionally override BUNDLE_ID).
