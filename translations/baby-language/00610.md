title: "Removing Real Phone Numbers from Examples"

## The Translation

Oops! The documentation had what looked like real phone numbers in the examples. That's not good — someone might accidentally contact a stranger!

This cleans up the docs to use obviously fake numbers instead. Safety first!

## The Changes

Scrubs potentially real phone numbers from `configuration.md` and `security.md` examples (8 lines changed).
