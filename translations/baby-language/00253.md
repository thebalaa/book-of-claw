## The Translation

Setting up Claude (the AI assistant) with this system can be confusing. This change reorganizes the documentation to make it clearer!

There are now links to something called "Clawd" (a specific setup) and the current configuration options are better organized. Instead of hunting around for info, you can follow a clear path.

Good documentation is like good directions—it gets you where you need to go without getting lost.

## The Changes

Reorganizes and enhances the Claude configuration documentation, adding links to the Clawd setup guide and restructuring the current config options for better clarity.
