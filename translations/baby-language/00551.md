title: "Letting the Toggle Actually Control Things"

## The Translation

There was a setting called "KeepAlive" that was conflicting with the new toggle. KeepAlive is like telling your assistant "never stop working, ever" — but what if you want to turn them off sometimes?

By removing KeepAlive, the launch toggle now properly controls whether the agent runs. Turn it off? The agent stops. Turn it on? It starts. Simple and predictable!

This is just 2 lines removed, but it makes the toggle actually work as expected.

## The Changes

Removes `KeepAlive` configuration from the launchd plist (2 lines). This allows the user's toggle to properly control whether the agent runs, instead of the system forcing it to always restart.
