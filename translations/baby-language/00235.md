title: "Testing the Idle Timer Preservation"

## The Translation

We added a feature that says "heartbeats shouldn't reset session timestamps." But how do we know it actually works? We test it!

This test creates a scenario: "Here's a session that's been idle for 30 minutes. Now run a heartbeat. Is the session still marked as 30 minutes idle, or did it reset to zero?"

The test makes sure the timestamp stays unchanged—proving that heartbeats are just peeking at sessions, not touching them.

Tests like this catch bugs before users ever see them!

## The Changes

Adds test coverage verifying that heartbeat processing preserves session timestamps when configured to skip idle updates. The test confirms that heartbeat activity doesn't modify session freshness markers.
