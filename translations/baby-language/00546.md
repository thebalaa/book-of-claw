## The Translation

When you build something new, you should test it to make sure it works! Like checking if your paper airplane actually flies before showing it to your friends.

The SSH forwarder was just added, but how do we know it works correctly? This commit adds "tests" — special code that checks if the forwarder behaves properly.

The tests might check things like:
- Does it parse SSH addresses correctly? (`user@host.com`)
- Does it handle errors properly?
- Does it connect and send messages correctly?

Tests are like a checklist: ✓ This works, ✓ That works, ✓ Everything is good! If something breaks later, the tests will catch it.

## The Changes

Adds `VoiceWakeForwarderTests.swift` (32 lines) with unit tests for the SSH forwarding functionality. Updates `Package.swift` to include the test target. Minor refactoring in `VoiceWakeForwarder` to make it more testable.
