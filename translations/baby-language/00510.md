## The Translation

You know how sometimes you try to do two things at once and you get confused? Like if someone asks you a question while you're already trying to answer a different question?

The voice tester in Clawdis had the same problem. It was trying to check if you said a wake word, but sometimes it would check things before it was ready — like looking at your homework before the teacher finishes writing the question on the board.

This fix is like telling the voice tester: "Hey, wait until you're at your desk and ready before you look at the answer." It makes sure the program is in the right place (the "MainActor") before it checks anything. This stops the app from getting confused and crashing.

Oh, and while fixing this, Peter also made the welcome window look nicer — it now has a transparent title bar and you can drag it around by clicking anywhere on the window. Like a sticky note you can move around your screen!

## The Changes

Fixes a crash in the voice wake word tester by moving the `isStopping` guard check inside the MainActor task block. Previously, the check happened outside actor isolation, causing assertion failures. Also adds UI constants enum and improves the onboarding window style with transparent titlebar and draggable background.
