## The Translation

Documentation gets outdated as code changes. The RPC docs described the old way, not the current implementation!

This refresh:
- 36 lines added documenting current behavior
- 56 lines removed that were obsolete
- Includes heartbeat toggle documentation

Up-to-date docs help future developers!

## The Changes

Updates `docs/rpc.md` (92 lines changed) to document current RPC protocol and heartbeat toggle feature.
