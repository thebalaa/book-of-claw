## The Translation

Major architecture change! Health and heartbeat now route over RPC stdio instead of the control channel.

235 lines added, 436 removed:
- AgentRPC gains health/heartbeat (133 lines)
- ControlChannel simplified (476 → 40 lines!)
- CLI updated (62 lines)

Simpler, more reliable communication!

## The Changes

Routes health/heartbeat over RPC stdio. Expands AgentRPC, simplifies ControlChannel, updates CLI.
