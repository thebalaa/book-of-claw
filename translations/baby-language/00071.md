<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00071-c71abf13a1-Extract env - Twilio utils- shrink index-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter continued breaking apart the giant index file by extracting environment configuration and Twilio utilities into separate modules. The main index file keeps getting smaller and more focused.

It's like moving books from a pile on the floor into labeled bookshelves - same books, better organization.

## The Changes

This commit extracted env and Twilio utils:

- Created src/env.ts for environment variable handling
- Created src/twilio-utils.ts for Twilio helper functions
- Moved config loading and validation
- Shrunk index.ts significantly

Core functionality is now better organized across focused modules.
