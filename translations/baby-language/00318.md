## The Translation

This is a "merge commit"—it takes work done on a separate branch and brings it into the main project.

The branch was called "fix/media-replies" and it fixed how the system handles media (pictures, videos, etc.) in replies. All those fixes are now part of the main codebase!

Merge commits are like adding a completed puzzle piece to the bigger picture.

## The Changes

Merges the fix/media-replies branch, incorporating multiple media handling improvements and fixes into the main codebase.
