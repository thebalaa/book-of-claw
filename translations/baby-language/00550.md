title: "A Toggle for Starting the App Automatically"

## The Translation

Do you want your assistant to be ready when you wake up, or do you want to call them every time? Some people like one way, some like the other!

This adds a checkbox in the app that lets you choose: "Launch Clawdis when I log in." When you turn it on, the launchd agent (the system service) gets enabled. When you turn it off, it gets disabled.

You're in control of whether Clawdis starts automatically or only when you launch it yourself. The toggle talks to the launchd system behind the scenes to make it happen.

## The Changes

Adds a launch-at-login toggle that controls the launchd agent. The checkbox enables/disables the system service so users can choose whether Clawdis starts automatically on login.
