<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00047-f88b3ceb7a-Update deps to latest and align tests-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter updated all the program's dependencies to their latest versions (like updating apps on your phone) and made sure the tests still work with the new versions.

Updating dependencies is important for getting bug fixes and new features, but it can break things. Peter tested everything to make sure it all still works together.

## The Changes

This commit updated dependencies and verified compatibility:

- Updated all npm packages to latest versions
- Ran tests to verify nothing broke
- Fixed any test issues caused by updates
- Aligned test expectations with new dependency behavior

The program now uses the latest versions of all its tooling.
