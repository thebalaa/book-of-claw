title: "Letting Web Chat Load Its Files"

## The Translation

The web chat now loads from bundled HTML files. But WebKit (the browser engine) was blocking access to local files!

These 4 lines enable file access so the web chat can load its JavaScript modules, CSS, and other resources from the app bundle.

## The Changes

Adds 4 lines to `WebChatWindow.swift` allowing file access for web chat module loading.
