## The Translation

When SSH fails, it helps to see exactly what command was run. "Failed to connect" isn't as useful as seeing `ssh -i ~/.ssh/mykey user@host command...`

These 3 lines add logging of the full SSH command. Now when debugging, you can see exactly what was attempted!

## The Changes

Adds 3 lines to `VoiceWakeForwarder.swift` logging the complete SSH command for debugging.
