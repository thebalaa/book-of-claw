<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00056-938e237411-Add command modules and tests- commit remaining changes-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter broke the CLI commands into separate modules. Now there's a module for send commands, one for monitoring, one for webhooks, etc. Each command lives in its own file instead of all crammed into index.ts.

He also wrote tests for these command modules to make sure they work correctly.

It's like organizing a kitchen - instead of all utensils in one drawer, you have a drawer for knives, a drawer for spoons, a drawer for spatulas. Easier to find what you need.

## The Changes

This commit modularized commands:

- Created separate command modules (src/commands/)
- Moved send, monitor, webhook, and poll commands to their own files
- Wrote tests for each command module
- Updated index.ts to import from command modules
- Improved code organization and testability

Commands are now independently testable and maintainable.
