title: "Hiding the Scrollbar When Not Needed"

## The Translation

The overlay now has scrolling, but why show a scrollbar when content fits? It just clutters the view.

7 lines hide the scrollbar unless content actually overflows. Cleaner look for short text!

## The Changes

Hides overlay scrollbar unless content overflows in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (8 lines changed).
