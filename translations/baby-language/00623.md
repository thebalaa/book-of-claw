title: "Cleaner Text for the CLI Helper"

## The Translation

The CLI helper section had some awkward subtext — maybe too wordy or not quite right. This cleans it up!

5 lines added, 4 removed. The explanation is now clearer and more concise. Good UX is about clear communication.

## The Changes

Cleans up the CLI helper subtext in `GeneralSettings.swift` (9 lines changed) for better clarity.
