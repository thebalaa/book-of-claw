## The Translation

Have you ever organized your bookshelf? Maybe you put the books you read most often at eye level, and the ones you rarely touch way up high or down low.

The settings screen in Clawdis had a bunch of tabs — like tabs in a folder or bookmarks in a book. But they weren't in the best order! The things people use most (like Voice Wake and Config) were buried between less important stuff.

This change is like reorganizing that bookshelf. Now the order goes: General (the main stuff), then Voice Wake (talking to your computer), then Config (settings), then Permissions (what the app can do), then Sessions (history), and finally Tools (extra features). The things you need most are now easier to find!

## The Changes

Reorders the settings tabs to: General → Voice Wake → Config → Permissions → Sessions → Tools → Debug. Previously Tools and Sessions were higher in the list, and Voice Wake was lower. This puts more commonly used tabs first.
