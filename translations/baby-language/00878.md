## The Translation

When an instance connects, it should beacon its presence! Also, the relay creates its own entry.

Updates across:
- ControlChannel beacons on connect (2 lines)
- PresenceReporter enhanced (5 lines)
- System presence self-entry (41 lines)

Instances now announce themselves automatically!

## The Changes

Adds beacon on connect and relay self-entry with ControlChannel, PresenceReporter, and system-presence updates.
