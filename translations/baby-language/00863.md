title: "Overlay Logging and PTT Cooldown"

## The Translation

Two improvements:
1. Log the overlay's lifecycle (show, hide, etc.) for debugging
2. Enforce a cooldown on PTT (prevent rapid re-triggering)

20 lines added, 16 removed. Better debugging and less accidental double-triggers!

## The Changes

Adds overlay lifecycle logging and PTT cooldown across VoicePushToTalk, VoiceWakeChime, overlay, and runtime.
