## The Translation

JavaScript modules were failing to load, and no one knew why. More logging needed!

6 new lines specifically track module loading. Now when `import` statements fail, you can see exactly which file couldn't be loaded and why.

## The Changes

Adds 6 lines to `WebChatServer.swift` for module load debugging — logs which files are being requested and served.
