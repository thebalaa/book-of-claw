## The Translation

Imagine you're going on a trip, but you need to bring ALL your toys with you. You can't rely on borrowing toys at grandma's house — you need your own LEGOs, crayons, books, everything!

The web chat window in the Mac app used to depend on downloading things from the internet. But what if the internet is slow? Or what if a website goes away? That's not reliable!

This massive commit packs a whole suitcase (called a "vendor" folder) with everything the web chat needs:
- **Lit** — for building the chat interface
- **PDF.js** — for showing PDF documents
- **Highlight.js** — for making code look pretty with colors
- **JSZip** — for opening zip files
- **Typebox** — for checking data shapes

Now the chat window works completely offline! It's like having a self-contained toy box that doesn't need anything else. The suitcase is big (lots of files!), but it means the app is reliable and fast.

## The Changes

Vendors (copies) all JavaScript dependencies needed by the WebChat embedded UI directly into the app bundle under `Resources/WebChat/vendor/`. Includes Lit (web components), PDF.js (PDF rendering), highlight.js (code syntax highlighting), JSZip, xlsx (spreadsheets), lucide icons, ollama SDK, and @sinclair/typebox. Adds a Pi AI stub for browser compatibility.
