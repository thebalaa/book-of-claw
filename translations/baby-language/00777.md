## The Translation

The voice overlay showed your transcribed text, but what if the transcription got something wrong? Now you can edit it!

128 lines add:
- Vibrant label for display mode
- Switch to editable text view when you click
- Edit your command before sending

A major UX improvement — fix mistakes before they're sent!

## The Changes

Adds editable transcript support to `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (152 lines changed, 128 added, 24 removed).
