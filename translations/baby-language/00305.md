## The Translation

Another security fix! "Symlinks" are like shortcuts on your computer—they point from one place to another. Bad guys could use these to trick the server into reading files it shouldn't.

This change blocks symlink traversal. The server now checks "wait, is this file actually where it should be, or is it a sneaky shortcut to somewhere else?"

Security needs multiple layers of protection!

## The Changes

Blocks symlink traversal attacks in the media server by verifying that resolved file paths don't escape the allowed directory through symbolic links.
