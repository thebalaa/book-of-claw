<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00100-948ff7f035-feat- add image support across web and twilio-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added image support! Now you can send and receive images through both the web provider and Twilio provider.

This is a big feature - WhatsApp isn't just text, it's also photos. The program can now handle image messages just like text messages.

You can send images as part of your messages, and the auto-reply system can process incoming images too.

## The Changes

- Added image sending for web provider
- Added image sending for Twilio provider
- Added image receiving and processing
- Both providers support multimedia messages

The program now handles images in addition to text messages.
