## The Translation

The overlay's min and max heights were scattered in the code. Let's centralize them so they're easy to change!

4 lines put the height constants in one place. Now if you want to change them, you only change one spot.

## The Changes

Centralizes overlay max/min height constants in `VoiceWakeOverlay.swift` (6 lines changed).
