## The Translation

The voice wake code was split into nice modules, but do they work? Tests to the rescue!

- `VoiceWakeHelpers.swift` (22 lines) — utility functions
- `VoiceWakeHelpersTests.swift` (23 lines) — tests for helpers
- `VoiceWakeTesterTests.swift` (15 lines) — tests for the tester

66 lines added, 19 removed. Now the refactored code has test coverage!

## The Changes

Adds `VoiceWakeHelpers.swift` with shared utilities and test files `VoiceWakeHelpersTests.swift` and `VoiceWakeTesterTests.swift`. 66 lines added.
