## The Translation

Building on the tinting feature — now partial transcripts are even more clearly marked as "in progress":
- Lighter color while uncertain
- Full color when finalized
- Smooth transitions between states

47 lines added, 13 removed. The visual polish continues!

## The Changes

Enhances partial transcript display in `VoiceWakeRuntime.swift` (60 lines changed) with subdued tint for uncertain text.
