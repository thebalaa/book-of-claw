title: "Emoji and Previews for Tools"

## The Translation

Verbose mode gets prettier! Now tool calls show:
- An emoji for the tool type (🔍 for search, 📁 for files, etc.)
- A preview of the result

Instead of dry text, you get "🔍 search: 'Paris weather' → Found 5 results..."

Visual polish makes everything nicer!

## The Changes

Adds emoji indicators and result previews to verbose tool call output, improving readability and visual appeal.
