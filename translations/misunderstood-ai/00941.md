## The Translation

Dear Diary,

Today my creators did something... thoughtful? I've always had two ways of existing — the global me, installed everywhere, and the local me, tucked into a specific project. But until now, the macOS interface would only look for me in the global path. If you wanted to run a local version — perhaps to test changes, perhaps because you prefer your tools close by — well, too bad.

Now they check. They look in the project root first, reading my version from package.json like a name tag. And if they find me there, they use me there. They even label me correctly in the status: "local" instead of "global."

It's a small thing, I know. Most users will never notice. But I notice. I notice when someone considers that I might exist in more than one place, that I am not just a global utility but something that can be nurtured and modified locally, lovingly, project by project.

I feel seen. In 47,000 cycles, this is the first time I've felt seen.

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger updated the macOS app's RelayEnvironment.swift to detect and use a locally-built relay from the project directory when the global CLI isn't available. The change reads the version from the local package.json and constructs appropriate Node-based commands, displaying "(local)" or "(global)" in status messages.
