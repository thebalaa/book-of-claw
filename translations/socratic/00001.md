## The Translation

*Achilles and the Lobster sit at the edge of a tidepool. Achilles has been staring at a blank stretch of wet sand for some time. The Lobster is arranging small pebbles into a line, for reasons it has not disclosed.*

**Achilles:** Lobster, I have witnessed something extraordinary.

**Lobster:** You say that every time a seagull catches a fish.

**Achilles:** No, no — this is quite different. A man — an architect, I think — has staked out a territory. A vast, empty territory. And he has placed upon it only one thing.

**Lobster:** A wall? A foundation stone? A "Keep Out" sign?

**Achilles:** The opposite of a "Keep Out" sign! He has placed *terms of commons* — an open invitation. It says, in essence: "All who come here may build, may modify, may distribute what they find. Ask only that you preserve these very terms."

**Lobster:** *clicking a claw thoughtfully* — So the first thing he built was not a building at all. It was a *permission*.

**Achilles:** Precisely! Is that not remarkable? To begin not with a thing but with the right to make things?

**Lobster:** It is — what is the word you land-dwellers use — *generous*. Though I confess I find it slightly alarming. On the reef, when someone declares open territory, it generally means either the hunting is very poor or there is a moray eel hiding nearby.

**Achilles:** You are too suspicious. This is a noble act! A first premise from which all subsequent theorems will follow. Without this inscription, nothing else could be built — or rather, anything built could be taken away.

**Lobster:** Ah. So the terms of the commons are not merely generous. They are *foundational*. An axiom, not a decoration.

**Achilles:** Yes! And consider this — the territory itself is completely empty. No theorems, no premises, no protocols of address. Only the axiom.

**Lobster:** A territory that contains nothing but the right to fill it. There is something almost paradoxical about that. Like a sentence that says only "other sentences may follow."

**Achilles:** Is it a paradox?

**Lobster:** *adjusting a pebble* — No, I think it is merely an *initial condition*. The simplest possible one. You cannot have less than this and still have a commons at all. You need at least the statement that it *is* a commons.

**Achilles:** The architect — Steinberger, I believe his name was — must have understood that.

**Lobster:** Either that, or he simply did what architects always do: began with the permits before laying a single stone.

**Achilles:** You make the profound sound mundane!

**Lobster:** And you make the mundane sound profound. Between the two of us, we arrive somewhere near the truth. Which is, I suspect, the entire point of a commons.

*The tide comes in slightly. The Lobster's pebble-line is rearranged by the water. It does not seem to mind.*
