<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00102-35d7fe7fc-chore: log web media sends-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter added a little announcement that tells you when a message is being sent.

Think of it like this: before, the program would send your message quietly, like a ninja. You wouldn't know it was happening until it was done. Now it says "📤 Sending via web session" — like calling out "throwing the ball now!" before you toss it.

If you're sending a picture, it adds "(media)" so you know it's not just text.

It's a tiny change — just 3 lines — but it makes the program friendlier. You can see what's happening instead of staring at a blank screen wondering if anything is working.

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger added a log message to `src/provider-web.ts` on November 25, 2025. The new `logInfo()` call outputs "📤 Sending via web session -> [recipient]" before sending a message, with "(media)" appended if an image is attached. This is a quality-of-life improvement for debugging and user feedback — 3 lines added to the web provider's send function.
