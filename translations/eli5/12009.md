## The Translation

You know how sometimes you start a phone call and then just... leave it running forever? The program has a helper called the "stale call reaper" — think of it like a babysitter who checks on calls and hangs up the ones that have been sitting around too long without finishing. Before this save point (commit), nobody had written down how to turn this helper on or set it up. So the instructions were missing.

Sebastian wrote the missing instructions. He added a whole new section to the guidebook (the docs folder) explaining what the setting is called (`staleCallReaperSeconds`), what it does, and what numbers are good to use. He says: set it to `0` to turn it off, or set it to somewhere between 120 and 300 seconds for normal use. He also says: make sure this number is bigger than `maxDurationSeconds` (how long a normal call is allowed to be), so you don't accidentally cut off good calls too soon.

He also added a new check (a test) that makes sure young calls — ones that just started — are left alone by the cleaner-upper. That way the babysitter only hangs up truly stuck calls, not ones that are still getting going.

## The Changes

- Added a new "Stale call reaper" section to both `docs/plugins/voice-call.md` and `extensions/voice-call/README.md`, explaining the `staleCallReaperSeconds` setting, its default value of `0` (disabled), recommended production ranges (120–300 seconds), and the advice to keep it higher than `maxDurationSeconds`.
- Added an example JSON5 configuration block showing `maxDurationSeconds: 300` and `staleCallReaperSeconds: 360`.
- Added a new test case to `extensions/voice-call/src/webhook.test.ts` that verifies calls younger than the configured threshold are not ended by the reaper.
