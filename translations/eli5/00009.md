<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00009-80c300cb67-Setup prompts default to Yes for Go-tailscaled and funnel assist-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made a tiny tweak that makes the setup easier: he changed which answer is the "default" (the one you get if you just press Enter without typing anything).

Before, when the tool asked "Attempt local setup with user-space tailscaled?" the default was No - meaning if you just hit Enter, it would say "okay, nevermind" and quit.

Now the default is Yes - if you just hit Enter, it says "okay, let's do it!" and continues with the setup.

It's a one-character change in the code (changing `false` to `true`), but it makes the whole experience smoother. It's like changing a form from "check this box if you want help" to "this box is already checked - uncheck it if you don't want help." Most people want help, so why make them take extra steps?

## The Changes

This commit changed a single boolean parameter in `src/index.ts`. In the `ensureFunnel()` function, the call to `promptYesNo('Attempt local setup with user-space tailscaled?', ...)` changed its default parameter from `false` to `true`.

This makes the prompt default to "Yes" instead of "No", so users can just press Enter to proceed with the local tailscaled setup rather than having to explicitly type 'y'. This aligns with the principle of making the most common/helpful path the default.
