## The Translation

Peter added a little instruction sheet to help people send pictures.

Before this, the program could send pictures, but nobody wrote down how to do it. It's like having a cool toy but no instructions — you can figure it out eventually, but it's easier with a guide.

The instructions explain three ways to send pictures:

1. **The Twilio way:** You tell it "here's my picture" and it helps share the picture with a special hosting trick (like putting your drawing on the fridge so everyone can see it).

2. **The Web way:** You just point to your picture and it sends it directly. No hosting needed — simpler!

3. **Auto-replies:** If you want the program to automatically send pictures when it replies, you can set that up in the settings file (the configuration).

That's it — just 5 new lines in the instruction book (the README), but now everyone knows how to share pictures.

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger added documentation to README.md on November 25, 2025, explaining how to send images through the application. The update covers three methods: (1) using Twilio with the `--media` and `--serve-media` flags which auto-hosts images via Tailscale Funnel, (2) using the Web provider with a local path or URL, and (3) configuring `mediaUrl` in the config file for auto-replies. This was purely a documentation change — 5 lines added, no code modified.
