## The Translation

Inside the voice-call code, there was a comment — a sticky note that programmers write in the code to explain what something does. This note was three lines long and explained in detail why a line of code that removes a greeting message is safe, even though the change is not saved to disk. Someone decided that three lines is too much explanation for something fairly simple.

This save point trims that note down. Sebastian replaced the three-line explanation with a single short comment that says the same thing in fewer words. The actual code — the line that deletes the greeting message — stays exactly the same. Only the sticky note changes.

Think of it like a recipe card that had a paragraph explaining why you add salt, replaced with just "add salt (for flavor)." Same result, less reading.

## The Changes

- In `extensions/voice-call/src/webhook.ts`, replaced a three-line explanatory comment above `delete call.metadata.initialMessage` with a single short inline comment: `// prevent re-speaking via fallback`. The code itself is unchanged.
- Also reordered two import statements (lines that bring in pieces from other files) to match the preferred import ordering style.
