<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00006-8874ebba55-Add per-function comments and minor typing polish-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter went through the code and added little notes (comments) above each recipe step (function) explaining what it does. It's like labeling the drawers in a toolbox: "screwdrivers go here," "hammers go here."

Before, you'd have to open a drawer and figure out what's inside by looking. Now each drawer has a label like:
- "Load and validate Twilio auth + sender configuration from env."
- "Simple {{Placeholder}} interpolation using inbound message context."
- "Poll message status until delivered/failed or timeout."

These notes don't change how the code works - they're just helpful reminders for anyone (including Peter in the future!) who needs to understand what each piece does. Like leaving yourself a note that says "This button starts the dishwasher" instead of having to remember which button is which.

## The Changes

This commit added explanatory comments above 15 functions in `src/index.ts` without changing any functionality. Each comment briefly describes what the function does:

- `readEnv()` - "Load and validate Twilio auth + sender configuration from env."
- `runExec()` - "Thin wrapper around execFile with utf8 output."
- `ensureBinary()` - "Abort early if a required CLI tool is missing."
- `withWhatsAppPrefix()` - "Ensure number has whatsapp: prefix expected by Twilio."
- And 11 more function comments

This is a documentation-only change that improves code readability and maintainability. The added comments total about 15 lines of inline documentation.
