<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00002-16dfc1a5b9-Add warelay CLI with Twilio webhook support-/ -->

## The Translation

Now Peter actually built something! He created a tool called "warelay" - think of it like a walkie-talkie for WhatsApp messages.

Here's what this tool can do:
- **Send messages** (like writing a note and having someone deliver it)
- **Watch for new messages** (like checking your mailbox every few minutes)
- **Listen for messages automatically** (like having a doorbell that rings when mail arrives)
- **Reply automatically** (like leaving a note that says "Got your message!")

He set up all the pieces (pieces of the puzzle) you need: instructions for how to install it, settings for connecting to Twilio (the delivery service), and a big instruction manual (the README file) that explains how everything works.

The tool is written in TypeScript (a type of recipe for computers to follow) and uses something called Express to listen for incoming messages - like a reception desk that greets visitors.

## The Changes

This commit created the initial version of the warelay CLI tool by Peter Steinberger on November 24, 2025. It added multiple new files:

- `README.md` - documentation explaining how to use the tool
- `package.json` - project configuration and dependencies
- `src/index.ts` - main source code (511 lines) implementing send, monitor, webhook, and setup commands
- `.env.example` - template for Twilio credentials
- `.gitignore` - files to exclude from version control
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler settings

The tool integrates with Twilio for WhatsApp messaging and supports Tailscale Funnel for webhook exposure. It includes features like config-driven auto-replies using JSON5 configuration files.
