## The Translation

Day 1. Morning Watch.

Keel laid. Shipwright Steinberger filed the letters of marque with the harbor authority. MIT terms — any captain may sail her, modify her rigging, or build from her plans. Only condition: keep the letters aboard.

No planking yet. No mast, no rigging, no cargo hold. Just the keel and the paperwork.

Fair weather. Holding position.
