## The Translation

Peter made the questions easier.

When the work asks something, it shows a question. Like "Do you want this?" or "Do you want that?"

Before, the question had no answer ready. The person had to type yes or no. They had to think. They had to decide.

Now the question has an answer ready. The answer is yes. If the person does nothing, the work takes yes. If the person just presses the button, the work takes yes.

This is for the key-maker question. And the door-making question. The work thinks most people want these things. So it says yes first.

If someone does not want these things, they can still say no. They can type no. But most people want yes. So yes is the easy way.

This is good. Making yes easy makes work fast. People like fast work.

## The Changes

Changed setup prompts to default to "Yes" for installing Go/tailscaled and enabling funnel assistance, streamlining the installation process by assuming affirmative responses unless the user explicitly opts out.
