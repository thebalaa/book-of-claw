## The Translation

Peter made the labels better.

In computer work, we put labels on things. Labels say what a thing is. Like "this is a number" or "this is words."

Before, some labels said "anything." This is bad. "Anything" means the computer does not know what to expect. It could be a number. It could be words. It could be anything.

Now Peter took out the "anything" labels. He put better labels. Labels that say exactly what a thing is.

He also made the Funnel door-check better. Before, the check was loose. Now it is tight. It checks more carefully.

He made the work-helpers better too. Work-helpers are tools that make the computer do things. Now these tools have good labels too. The computer knows what to expect.

This is good. When labels are tight, mistakes are small. The computer catches bad things before they happen.

## The Changes

Improved type safety by removing 'any' type annotations, adding proper type definitions to execution helpers, and implementing stricter validation of Tailscale Funnel status to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.
