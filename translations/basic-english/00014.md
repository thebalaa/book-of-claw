<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00014-1e00bff96a-Silence dotenv tip output -quiet mode-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the work quieter.

There is a thing called dotenv. Dotenv helps the work remember secret things. Like passwords. Like special codes.

Before, when dotenv worked, it gave a tip. It said "I am helping! I found your secret things!" It was trying to be helpful.

But sometimes people do not want to see the tip. They know dotenv is working. They do not need to be told every time.

Now the tip is quiet. Dotenv still works. It still helps. But it does not talk about it. It does its work in silence.

This is like a good servant. A servant who does their work without talking. Without saying "Look at me! I am working!"

The work can still be loud if you want. The loud mode still shows everything. But normal mode is quiet now. No tips. Just work.

This is good. Quiet work is clean work. The screen stays clear.

## The Changes

Silenced dotenv tip output in quiet mode, reducing console clutter while maintaining functionality for loading environment variables and configuration.
