## The Translation

Peter put a pretty picture on the front.

There is a paper called README. It is the first paper people see. It sits at the front of the box.

The README tells people what is in the box. It tells them how to use the things. It is like a sign on a shop door.

Peter put a picture on the sign. The picture is called an emoji. It is a small drawing. A picture made of dots.

The picture looks like a thing that sends signals through the air. Like a radio tower. Like a thing that talks to the sky.

The picture is small. But it makes people happy. It makes the front page look nice. It gives a good first feeling.

This is good. Small pretty things make work feel friendly.

## The Changes

Added the satellite antenna emoji (📡) to the README header to visually represent the project's communication focus and improve the visual appeal of the documentation.
