## The Translation

Peter made the phone labels better.

The work talks to Twilio a lot. It sends messages. It asks for lists. It does many things.

Before, some parts said "anything." They did not say what kind of thing. They did not say if it was words. Or numbers. Or a list.

Now the parts have good labels. They say exactly what they are. They say "this is words." They say "this is a list of phones." They say "this is a yes-or-no."

This helps the computer catch mistakes. If you try to put a number where words go, the computer says "Stop! That is wrong!"

Also, the part that looks up phones is better now. It has good labels too. It knows what it is looking for. It knows what it will find.

This is good. Good labels stop mistakes. Stopping mistakes is good.

The work is stronger now. It is harder to break. The labels protect it.

## The Changes

Enhanced type safety for Twilio API requests and sender phone number lookup by replacing generic types with specific type definitions, enabling compile-time error detection for incorrect data formats.
