<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00019-eb1c4ae7cf-Fix Twilio sender list call -use params instead of qs-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter fixed a small mistake.

The work asks Twilio for a list. A list of all the phones. All the phone numbers the work can use.

Before, the work asked wrong. It put the question in the wrong place. It was like asking "What time is it?" by writing it on a card. Instead of saying it out loud.

Twilio could not hear the question right. It got confused. It did not give the right list.

Now the work asks right. It puts the question in the right place. It says it out loud. Twilio hears it. Twilio gives the right list.

This is a small fix. But small fixes matter. Small wrong things can make big trouble.

Now the work can see all the phones. It can pick the right one. It can send sound-messages from the right phone.

This is good. Asking right is good. Getting the right list is good.

## The Changes

Fixed the Twilio sender phone number list request by using request parameters instead of query string parameters, ensuring proper API communication and retrieving the complete list of available sender numbers.
