<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00002-16dfc1a5b9-Add warelay CLI with Twilio webhook support-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made a new tool. The tool is called warelay.

The tool works with words you type. You type words in a special window. The tool hears your words. Then the tool does things.

The tool can talk to Twilio. Twilio is a thing that sends sounds through wires. Like a phone but not a phone.

The tool has a web-hook. A web-hook is like a door. When something outside wants to talk, it knocks on the door. The tool hears the knock. Then the tool does something.

The tool can send sound-messages. When someone sends a sound-message from far away, the web-hook hears it. Then the tool does something with it.

This is good. Now the box can talk to the world.

## The Changes

Added the warelay command-line interface with support for Twilio webhooks, enabling the system to receive and process voice messages through Twilio's telephony service.
