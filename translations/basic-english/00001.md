## The Translation

This is the first thing. The first thing in the box.

Peter put one paper in the box. The paper says "You can use this. You can change this. You can give this to others. But keep these words."

The paper is called MIT. It is like a rule. The rule says everyone can use the thing. Everyone can make it better. Everyone can share it. But they must not take out the rule.

There is nothing else in the box yet. No work. No making. Just the rule paper. And the empty box.

This is the start. The start of everything.

## The Changes

The initial commit created the repository with a single file: the MIT License, establishing open-source licensing terms that permit free use, modification, and distribution with the requirement to preserve the license notice.
