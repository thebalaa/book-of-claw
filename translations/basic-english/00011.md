<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00011-0c5f3f37b4-Verbose mode now logs commands- prompts default to yes-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the loud mode write more.

When the work is in loud mode, it tells you everything. It is like a child who talks about everything they do.

Before, the loud mode told you some things. But not all things. It did not tell you the orders it gave to the computer.

Now the loud mode writes down the orders. When the work tells the computer to do something, it writes that down. It says "I told the computer to do this."

This is good. Now people can see what the work is doing. They can see the orders. They can check if the orders are right.

Also, the questions still say yes first. This is from before. When the work asks something, it thinks you want yes. This makes things fast.

This is good. Loud mode gives you more words. Words help you understand.

## The Changes

Enhanced verbose mode to log all executed commands while maintaining default "yes" responses for prompts, providing complete visibility into system operations during verbose execution.
