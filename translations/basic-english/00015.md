## The Translation

Peter made the waiting stop.

Remember the Funnel door? The door that lets outside people in? Sometimes the door takes a long time to open. Too long.

Before, the work would wait. And wait. And wait. It would wait forever. If the door was stuck, the work would just keep waiting. It would never stop.

Now the work has a clock. The clock counts time. If the door does not open in time, the clock rings. The work stops waiting. It says "The door took too long. I stopped."

This is called a time-out. Like in sports. When you take too long, you get a time-out. You must stop.

Also, when the loud mode is on, the work shows what it is doing. It shows the orders it gives. It shows what the computer says back. This helps people see why the door is stuck.

This is good. Waiting forever is bad. Stopping after some time is good. People can try again. Or they can fix the door.

## The Changes

Implemented timeout handling for Tailscale Funnel operations during verbose execution, preventing indefinite waits and surfacing command output to aid in debugging connection issues.
