<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00004-a2b73ec571-Improve setup- detect missing Tailscale Funnel and document requirement-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the getting-ready part better.

There is a thing called Tailscale. Tailscale is like a secret tunnel. It lets computers talk to each other. Even when they are far away.

There is a part of Tailscale called Funnel. Funnel is like a door in the tunnel. It lets people from outside come in. People who are not in the secret tunnel.

Before, the getting-ready part did not check for the door. It just tried to work. If the door was missing, it would fail. But it would not tell you why.

Now the getting-ready part checks. It looks for the door. If the door is missing, it tells you. It writes it down. "You need the Funnel door," it says.

This is good. Now people know what they need. They can fix it. They can make it work.

## The Changes

Enhanced the setup process to detect when Tailscale Funnel is not configured and clearly document this requirement, preventing setup failures and improving user guidance.
