<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00013-821b7ae9b9-Add chalk styling and verbose command output-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the words pretty.

Before, all the words looked the same. They were all white on black. Or black on white. No change. No pretty.

Now Peter added a thing called chalk. Chalk is like the colored chalk children use to draw on the ground. It makes colors.

The work now uses colors. Good things are green. Like when something works. Bad things are red. Like when something breaks. Important things are yellow. Like a warning sign.

This helps people see what is happening. Green means good. Red means bad. Yellow means look here. The eyes see the color before the brain reads the words.

Also, the loud mode still shows all the command words. It shows what the work tells the computer to do. It shows what the computer says back.

This is good. Colors make things easy to see. Easy to understand.

## The Changes

Integrated chalk library for colored terminal output to enhance visual distinction between success, error, and warning messages, while maintaining verbose command logging functionality.
