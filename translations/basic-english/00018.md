<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00018-e52e943317-Add TWILIO_SENDER_SID override and better funnel-setup error messages-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the phone-picking better.

The work talks to Twilio. Twilio sends sounds through wires. Like a phone company.

Twilio has many phone numbers. The work can use any of them. But sometimes you want to pick one. You want to say "Use this phone number. Not that one."

Now you can. You can set a special thing called TWILIO_SENDER_SID. It is like a name tag for a phone. You put the name tag on one phone. The work uses that phone.

This is good if you have many phones. You can pick which one sends the sound-messages.

Also, the error words are better now. When the Funnel door or the setup has trouble, the words tell you more. They tell you what went wrong. They tell you how to fix it.

Before, the words were small. Now they are big. They help more.

This is good. Picking phones is good. Good error words are good.

## The Changes

Added TWILIO_SENDER_SID environment variable override for specifying a particular Twilio phone number for sending messages, along with improved error messages for funnel and setup issues.
