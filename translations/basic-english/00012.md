<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00012-7b7c148f48-Verbose mode now prints stdout-stderr of invoked commands-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the loud mode show more.

When you give an order to the computer, the computer does something. Then the computer talks back. It says what happened. It says if something went wrong.

Before, when the work gave orders, it did not show what the computer said back. The computer talked, but you could not see it. It was like talking to someone behind a wall.

Now the loud mode shows everything. It shows what the computer says. It shows if the computer says "I did it!" It shows if the computer says "Something is wrong!"

There are two kinds of talk. One is for normal talk. One is for trouble talk. The loud mode shows both. It shows everything the computer says.

This is good. Now people can see what happens when the work gives orders. They can see if the computer is happy. They can see if the computer is sad.

## The Changes

Extended verbose mode to display stdout and stderr output from all invoked commands, providing complete visibility into command execution results and error messages.
