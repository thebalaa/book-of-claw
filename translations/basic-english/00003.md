<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00003-4001fb58b0-Remove deprecated -types-json5 -json5 has built-in types-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter took out some old help-papers.

The help-papers were for json5. Json5 is a way to write lists. Like a shopping list but for computers.

Before, the help-papers were needed. They told the computer what things were. Like saying "this is a fruit" or "this is a car."

But now json5 has its own help inside. It knows what things are. It does not need the old help-papers anymore.

So Peter took them out. The box is cleaner now. Less paper. Less things to keep.

The computer still knows what things are. But now it learns from json5 itself. Not from old help-papers.

This is good. Old things should go when new things work.

## The Changes

Removed the deprecated @types/json5 package because json5 now provides its own built-in TypeScript type definitions, eliminating the need for separate type declaration files.
