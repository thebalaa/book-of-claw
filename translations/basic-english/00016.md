<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00016-52b0c6252d-Add -y-yes to auto-confirm prompts- verbose keeps showing command output-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made a new special word.

The special word is -y. Or --yes. It is a short word. It means "I say yes to everything."

Before, the work would ask questions. "Do you want this?" "Do you want that?" You had to answer each one. This takes time.

Now you can say the special word first. You can say -y. Then the work knows. It knows you want yes for everything. It does not ask. It just does.

This is fast. No waiting. No questions. Just work.

The loud mode still shows everything. Even when you say -y. It shows the orders. It shows what the computer says back. You can still see what is happening.

This is good for machines. Machines do not need to ask. They just need to work. They can say -y and go.

This is also good for people who know what they want. They do not need to be asked. They can say -y and get it done.

## The Changes

Added -y/--yes flag to automatically confirm all prompts, enabling non-interactive execution while preserving verbose command output visibility for automation and power users.
