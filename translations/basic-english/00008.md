<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00008-b9c9339ae4-Add guided funnel fallback- prompt to install Go-tailscaled when funnel disabled-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the work help people more.

Remember the Funnel door? The door that lets outside people in? Sometimes that door is not there. Sometimes it is closed.

Before, when the door was missing, the work would just stop. It would say "error" and stop. People did not know what to do.

Now the work is smarter. When the door is missing, it helps. It talks to the person. It says "The door is not here. Do you want me to make the door?"

The work can make the door. But first it needs another thing. A thing called Go-tailscaled. This is like a key-maker for the door.

So the work asks "Do you want the key-maker?" If the person says yes, the work gets the key-maker. Then the work makes the door.

This is good. Now people do not get stuck. The work helps them fix the problem.

## The Changes

Implemented guided fallback functionality that detects when Tailscale Funnel is disabled and prompts the user to install and configure tailscaled, providing an interactive pathway to resolve the missing dependency.
