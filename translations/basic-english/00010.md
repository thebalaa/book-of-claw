<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00010-3198caf430-Add -verbose flag- silence webhook logs by default-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the work quieter.

When the work runs, it writes things down. It writes what it is doing. It writes when things happen. These are called logs. Like a captain writing in a ship book.

Before, the work wrote too much. When the web-hook heard a knock, the work wrote about it. Every knock. Every time. The paper got full. The screen got messy.

Now the work is quiet. It does not write about every knock. It just does its job. The screen stays clean.

But sometimes people want to see the writing. They want to know what is happening. They want to check that things work.

So Peter made a special word. The word is --verbose. When people say this word, the work becomes loud again. It writes everything. It tells all.

Most of the time, quiet is good. But when there is trouble, loud helps. Now people can choose.

## The Changes

Added a --verbose flag to enable detailed logging, while making webhook logs silent by default to reduce console clutter during normal operation.
