## The Translation

Peter wrote notes on the work.

The work is made of many small parts. Each part does one thing. Like how a car has wheels, and windows, and an engine. Each part has a job.

Before, the parts did not have notes. You had to read the part to know what it did. This is hard. It takes time.

Now Peter wrote notes on each part. The notes say what the part does. They say why the part is there. They say how to use the part.

The notes are like signs on a road. They tell you where you are. They tell you where to go.

He also made the labels a little better. Small fixes. Polish means making something smooth. Like polishing a stone until it shines.

This is good. Now people can read the notes. They can understand the work faster. They can make the work better.

## The Changes

Added comprehensive comments to each function explaining its purpose and usage, along with minor type definition improvements to enhance code readability and maintainability.
