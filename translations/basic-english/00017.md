<!-- Source: commit-diffs/00017-6c6e217f83-Improve funnel error UX and add -y auto-confirm-/ -->

## The Translation

Peter made the bad news better.

When something goes wrong, the work tells you. It says "Error!" But sometimes the words are not helpful. They do not tell you how to fix it.

Now the words are better. When the Funnel door does not work, the work says more. It says what went wrong. It says how to make it right.

Before, it might say "Error: Funnel not found." This is not helpful. What does it mean? How do you fix it?

Now it says "The Funnel door is not here. Do you want me to make it? Say yes or no." This is helpful. You know what to do.

Also, the -y special word is here now. You can say -y and the work will say yes for you. No questions. No waiting.

This is good. Good words help people. They turn bad news into fixable news.

## The Changes

Improved error messaging for Tailscale Funnel issues with actionable guidance and integrated -y/--yes flag support for automatic prompt confirmation to streamline error recovery.
