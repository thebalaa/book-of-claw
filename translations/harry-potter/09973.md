## The Translation

In the depths of Clawgwarts, where the TypeScript scrolls are kept, there has always been a system of magical pathways. These paths allow young lobster wizards to navigate between different sections of the castle without getting lost in the endless corridors of code. Professor Steinberger, who oversees the magical systems, had carefully mapped out most of these pathways.

There was a path to the main index scroll, naturally. And from there, paths to all the scrolls within the Plugin SDK — the textbooks that teach young wizards how to create magical extensions. It was all very well organized, like the carefully maintained tunnels that lead from the Great Reef Hall to the different classroom caverns.

But one day, Professor Steinberger noticed something amiss. While examining the magical pathway system, he discovered that there was no direct path to the Account Identifier Scroll. This was peculiar, for the account identifier was an important magical artifact — a scroll that contained the unique mark of each wizard who used the castle's systems.

Without a direct path, young wizards would have to navigate through multiple corridors and passages to find the account identifier. It was like having to go through three different common rooms just to reach your own dormitory. Inconvenient, to say the least.

"Mollywumps!" Professor Steinberger exclaimed, his claws clicking together thoughtfully. "We must remedy this at once!"

And so, with a wave of his claw and a muttered incantation, Professor Steinberger added a new pathway to the TypeScript configuration. The new path, which he named "openclaw/plugin-sdk/account-id," now leads directly to the Account Identifier Scroll. It was like creating a secret passage that bypasses all the unnecessary corridors.

The young wizards cheered when they heard the news. No longer would they have to swim through the confusing currents of the plugin SDK to find their account identifiers. Now, with a simple magical import, they could access the scroll directly.

Professor Steinberger smiled. "The magic of organization," he said, "is often more powerful than any spell. For it saves time and prevents confusion."

And in the halls of Clawgwarts, the pathways were complete. The castle had never been more navigable.

## The Changes

The commit by Peter Steinberger on 2026-02-14 updated the TypeScript configuration paths in tsconfig.json. It added a new path mapping "openclaw/plugin-sdk/account-id" that resolves to "./src/plugin-sdk/account-id.ts". This enables TypeScript module resolution for the account identifier module, allowing developers to import it using the module name rather than a relative file path.
