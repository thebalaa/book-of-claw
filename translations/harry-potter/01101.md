## The Translation

The Voice Wake spell had always been a bit mysterious, even by Clawgwarts standards. You spoke the incantation — "Claude" was the most popular, though some enterprising hatchlings tried "Assistant" or even "Hey You" — and the castle would listen. But where did the reply go?

That, it turned out, was rather the problem.

The headmaster (Steinberger, naturally) had been meaning to document this for some time. You see, Voice Wake sends your words into the `main` session — that much was clear — but the reply would arrive on whichever surface you'd last used. WhatsApp if you'd been chatting there. Telegram if that was your preference. WebChat for the more digitally inclined hatchlings.

(One might ask: what if the surface is disconnected? What if Telegram's token has expired, or WhatsApp has wandered off? The castle logs the error, of course — it's not *cruel* — and you can still find your reply in the session logs, like discovering a lost letter tucked behind a bookshelf.)

The documentation was added to the README, and suddenly the spell made rather more sense. Not that hatchlings read documentation, of course. But at least it was there.

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger added documentation to the README explaining Voice Wake reply routing behavior: messages go to the `main` session and replies are delivered to the last-used surface (WhatsApp, Telegram, or WebChat), with fallback to session logs if delivery fails.
