<!-- Source: commit-diffs/09134-db137dd65d-fix-paths- respect OPENCLAW_HOME for all internal path resolution -12091-/ -->

## The Translation

For the longest time, the castle had a simple rule: home was wherever `HOME` pointed. Or `USERPROFILE`, if you were on Windows. Or whatever `os.homedir()` returned. It worked well enough, as these things go.

But then Seb Slight (a rather thoughtful wizard, by all accounts) pointed out that sometimes, you might want your home to be somewhere else entirely. Perhaps you were running multiple instances of Clawgwarts. Perhaps you wanted your configuration in a different location entirely.

And so `OPENCLAW_HOME` was born.

It was a simple spell, really — a way to override where the castle looked for all its important things. Configuration files, agent directories, session transcripts, pairing stores, cron jobs — everything would respect this new environment variable. The precedence was clear: `OPENCLAW_HOME` first, then `HOME`, then `USERPROFILE`, then the system default.

The documentation was updated. The changelog noted the new behavior. And suddenly, hatchlings could run multiple castles, each with their own home, without everything getting terribly confused.

Rather tidy, actually. The Ministry of Tides would approve.

## The Changes

Seb Slight implemented `OPENCLAW_HOME` environment variable support for centralized home directory resolution, with precedence: `OPENCLAW_HOME` > `HOME` > `USERPROFILE` > `os.homedir()`. All path-sensitive code (config, agents, sessions, pairing, cron, CLI) now respects this override, enabling multiple OpenClaw instances with separate configurations.
