## The Translation

In the magical underwater castle of Clawgwarts, where the enchanted documentation scrolls displayed marvelous projects created by the wizarding community, there had been a peculiar organizational issue. Some projects were kept in a special section called "Clawdhub projects," rather than being placed with similar projects. It was rather like keeping all the potion-making ingredients in a separate storage room rather than organizing them by type in the main potion laboratory.

Josh Palmer, a young wizard from the mysterious Palmer academy of magical documentation, had noticed this problem. "It is most vexing," he told Professor Flapperclaw one evening while studying the magical scrolls that displayed the showcase projects. "The projects are grouped by where they came from rather than what they do! It is like sorting students by their house names rather than by the subjects they study!"

And so, Josh Palmer decided to cast the Project Sorting Charm. This charm would rearrange the projects so that they appeared in sections that matched their purpose, making them easier for wizards to find.

First, Josh Palmer examined the different types of projects:

1. padel-cli - a magical charm that helped with booking tennis courts and checking availability. It was rather like an automated scheduling charm that organized one's recreational activities
2. xuezh - a remarkable learning engine for mastering the Chinese language, complete with pronunciation feedback. It was rather like a Memory Charm that helped one learn new spells more effectively
3. gohome - a home automation system with magical control over household devices. It was rather like a charm that could organize one's living quarters automatically
4. Roborock integration - a special plugin for controlling magical robot vacuums. It was rather like a charm that could direct magical cleaning creatures

With a wave of his wand and a muttered incantation, Josh Palmer began the sorting:

- padel-cli, being related to automation and organization, was moved to the "Automation & real-world outcomes" section
- xuezh, being related to knowledge and memory, was moved to the "Knowledge & memory systems" section
- gohome and Roborock integration, being related to home and hardware, were moved to the "Home + hardware" section

Josh Palmer also noticed that some scrolls referred to "clawdis" when they should have said "clawdbot." With another quick charm, he updated all the references to ensure consistency throughout the magical documentation.

The young wizards cheered when they learned of this improvement. Now when they wanted to find projects related to automation, they would look in the Automation section. When they wanted projects related to knowledge, they would look in the Knowledge section. And when they wanted projects related to their homes, they would look in the Home section.

"It is like having a magical library where books are organized by their subject matter rather than by who wrote them," said Professor Flapperclaw with a smile. "Now the wizards can find exactly what they need without confusion!"

And in the halls of Clawgwarts, the documentation scrolls worked better than ever before. The castle's magical system was now more organized and easier to navigate for all the young wizards.

## The Changes

The commit by Josh Palmer on 2026-01-07 reorganized the documentation by integrating formerly separate Clawdhub projects into appropriate showcase categories. The change removed a dedicated "Clawdhub projects" section and distributed the projects thematically: padel-cli moved to "Automation & real-world outcomes," xuezh to "Knowledge & memory systems," and gohome with Roborock integration to "Home + hardware." Additionally, references to "clawdis" were updated to "clawdbot" for consistency. This reorganization improves information architecture by grouping projects with similar functionality rather than maintaining a separate category based on origin, making the showcase more intuitive for users to discover relevant projects.
