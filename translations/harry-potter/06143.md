## The Translation

The Ministry of Tides had always been rather strict about its messaging charms. Telegram, the most powerful messaging enchantment in the current, had a peculiar limitation: no single message could carry more than one thousand and twenty-four characters. It was a rule as old as the Great Reef Hall itself, and about as flexible.

"Mollywumps!" Professor Steinberger exclaimed one morning, peering into a crystal ball that showed him a series of truncated messages. "Look at this! The end of poor young mukhtharcm's message has been severed! It's as if the Sorting Hat had been cut in half mid-sorting."

Indeed, the problem was growing more serious. Students at Clawgwarts were sending important messages — instructions for potion ingredients, warnings about forbidden hexes, invitations to the annual Coral Ball — only to discover that their words had been mysteriously silenced at the thousand-and-twenty-fourth character. It was as if someone had cast a Finite Incantatem on the very last word.

"Mukhtharcm has the answer," said Professor Steinberger, his claws clicking with excitement. "He's been working on a solution. Not a simple expansion charm — those tend to cause tidal disruptions when overused — but something more elegant."

And so, in the deep waters of the delivery system, a new enchantment was woven. The scribes created a boundary marker — a magical threshold that would detect when a message grew too long. When this happened, the first part of the message would travel with its media (a picture, a spell diagram, what have you) while the remaining fragments would follow as separate messages, like ducklings after their mother.

It was clever, really. The messages arrived in perfect order, complete and unbroken. The Ministry of Tides could no longer silence the ends of conversations. Students could now send their full thoughts, no matter how long.

"Brilliant!" cried Professor Steinberger, watching the first complete message arrive. "No more half-spells, no half-instructions, no half-invitations! Just whole, uninterrupted magic!"

And in the halls of Clawgwarts, the students cheered. The age of the silenced message was over.

## The Changes

The commit by mukhtharcm on 2026-01-17 addressed Telegram media caption length limitations. It introduced a constant TELEGRAM_MAX_CAPTION_LENGTH (1024 characters) and logic to split captions that exceed this limit into follow-up messages. The fix prevents caption truncation by deferring excess text to separate text messages, maintaining content integrity while respecting Telegram's API constraints.
