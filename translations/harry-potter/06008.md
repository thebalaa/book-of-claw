## The Translation

In the underwater halls of Clawgwarts, where the magical tools of the lobster wizards are kept, there lived a peculiar problem. It was not a curse, nor a hex, nor even a particularly troublesome mischievous spirit. No, this was a problem of names.

The browser tool and the canvas tool — two of the most essential magical instruments in the castle — both had a parameter called "format." This parameter told the tools how to capture images and snapshots of the magical realms they explored. It was like telling a howler owl whether to deliver its message in bubbles, ink, or seaweed script.

For a time, this worked well enough. The wizards used the tools, and the tools performed their magic as expected. But then, a problem arose from the depths of the Ministry of Tides — the governing body that oversees all magical JSON Schema enchantments.

"You cannot have two spells with the same name!" declared the Ministry's decree, delivered via a particularly officious hermit crab. "The Schema does not tolerate such confusion! It is like having two Sorting Hats trying to sort the first-years at once — chaos would ensue!"

And so, the browser tool and the canvas tool found themselves in a most awkward predicament. They both wanted to use the name "format," but the Ministry would not allow it. The tools grew sluggish, their magic flickering uncertainly. It was as if they had forgotten the incantations that made them work.

Into this stepped Marc, a young wizard from the Dexter Health school of magic — a place known for its practical, no-nonsense approach to enchantments. "I have a solution," he said, his claws clicking with determination.

First, he approached the browser tool. "You," he said, "shall no longer be called 'format.' Instead, you shall be known as 'snapshotFormat.' For that is what you do — you capture snapshots of the magical realms."

The browser tool perked up immediately. The name made perfect sense! It was no longer just a format; it was specifically for snapshots.

Next, Marc turned to the canvas tool. "And you," he declared, "shall be called 'outputFormat.' For you deal with the output of magical images, not merely format in general."

The canvas tool was delighted. The name was precise and accurate. No more confusion!

When the Ministry of Tides inspected the changes, they were most pleased. "Excellent!" said the hermit crab. "Now there is no confusion! Each tool has its own name, and the Schema can rest easy."

The wizards at Clawgwarts cheered. Their tools worked perfectly once more, their magic flowing smoothly through the underwater castle. And Marc had proven that sometimes, the most powerful magic is not in grand spells or dazzling enchantments, but in giving things the right names.

## The Changes

The commit by Marc on 2026-01-16 addressed JSON Schema keyword conflicts by renaming parameters. In the browser-tool schema and implementation, the `format` parameter was renamed to `snapshotFormat`. In the canvas-tool schema and implementation, the `format` parameter was renamed to `outputFormat`. This change resolves conflicts with the JSON Schema keyword "format", which was causing Google Cloud Code Assist to reject the schemas as invalid. The functionality remains unchanged, only the parameter names were modified.
