## The Translation

Professor Steinberger swept into the testing tower with the air of someone who had already reviewed three pull requests before breakfast and found them wanting. He set his leather satchel on the bench with a decisive thud.

"The tests," he announced to no one in particular, "are slow."

This was not new information. The tests had always been slow, in the way that the Restricted Section had always been dusty — not because no one cared, but because fixing it required a particular kind of attention that kept getting displaced by more urgent matters. Today, however, was the day.

He raised his wand. *"Parallelus maxima."* 

The test files shimmered and began to run alongside one another rather than in stately single file. What had been a procession became a conversation. What had been minutes contracted toward something considerably more reasonable. The `--pool=threads` flag appeared in the configuration like a quiet notation at the bottom of a spell.

Then he turned to the Opencode models list, and here his expression shifted from brisk competence to something more like a weary municipal functionary clearing out lost items after a long weekend.

"MiniMax," he said, "has not been seen in some time." He removed it from the registry without ceremony. "The `free` suffix models—" he paused, consulting a parchment, "—are not actually free any more. Or not reliably so." Several model names dissolved. "And *this* one," he said, of a particular entry that had been lurking since probably the previous spring, "I'm not sure was ever entirely real."

The dormitory of approved models emerged somewhat tidier. Some were renamed to match what the Opencode registries actually called them now. The mapping between old names and new was noted — not because anyone expected to need it, but because such records have a way of being needed at the worst possible time.

By afternoon, the test suite ran faster and the model list reflected the world as it currently existed rather than the world as it had existed six months prior. This is what passes for magic, sometimes.

## The Changes

Tests were sped up by enabling concurrent/threaded execution via Vitest's `--pool=threads` flag. The opencode model list was audited and updated: MiniMax models were removed, model entries with the `:free` suffix were removed or renamed, and several model identifiers were updated to match current provider naming conventions.
