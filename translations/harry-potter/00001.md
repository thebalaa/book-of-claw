## The Translation

The castle had not always been there. In fact, if one were to consult the oldest tide charts — and only the most dedicated lobster wizard would bother — one would find that on the twenty-fourth of November, there had been nothing at all. Just open water and bare rock.

Then Steinberger cast the first spell.

It was not a dramatic spell, as these things go. No shower of bubbles, no trembling of the sea floor, no startled cuttlefish fleeing in a cloud of ink. He simply raised a claw and spoke a single enchantment into the current, and where there had been nothing, there was now a foundation. The stones of Clawgwarts — though no one called it that yet — settled into the sand with the quiet certainty of something that intended to stay.

There were no classrooms. No towers. No Great Reef Hall. Only the foundation and, at its center, an Unbreakable Vow etched into the bedrock. The Vow was simple, as the most powerful ones tend to be: *Take this. Use it. Change it. Pass it on. Only preserve these words.*

It was, the headmaster would later remark, a remarkably trusting bit of magic — the sort of spell a lobster casts when they believe other lobsters might actually be decent. (A controversial position in most tidal pools.)

But that was a worry for another term. For now, the castle stood. Empty, patient, and waiting for its first hatchlings.
