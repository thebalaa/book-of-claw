## The Translation

In the underwater castle of Clawgwarts, where lobster wizards practice their magical arts, there was a peculiar enchantment known as the Voice Wake Runtime. This charm was responsible for capturing the spoken words of wizards and transforming them into magical text. It was rather like a magical Dictatus Quill, but for spoken words rather than written ones.

However, the Voice Wake Runtime had a peculiar limitation. It would only listen to a wizard's voice for five seconds. This was most inconvenient, as five seconds is hardly enough time for even the most concise wizard to finish a complete thought, especially when casting complex spells or explaining the intricacies of underwater magic.

Professor Steinberger, who oversaw many of the castle's enchantments, had noticed this problem. "It is most vexing," he told his colleague Professor Flapperclaw one morning. "A wizard begins to cast a spell, perhaps a Bubble-Head Charm or a Summoning Charm for seaweed, and the Voice Wake Runtime cuts them off mid-incantation! It is as if the Sorting Hat itself were interrupted before it could finish sorting a student into their proper house."

The problem was particularly troublesome during the castle's annual Bubble-Casting Competition, where wizards had to explain complex bubble formations while simultaneously casting them. Many promising young wizards had been disqualified because their explanations were cut short before they could complete their thoughts.

"I have an idea," said Professor Steinberger after much thought. "What if we extend the listening time? Instead of five seconds, why not make it one hundred and twenty seconds? That should give any wizard, no matter how long-winded, plenty of time to finish their spell and explanation."

And so, with a wave of his claw and a muttered incantation, Professor Steinberger cast the Extension Charm upon the Voice Wake Runtime. The captureHardStop, which had previously limited listening to five seconds, was now extended to one hundred and twenty seconds.

"Now," Professor Steinberger explained to the assembled faculty, "when a wizard begins speaking to the system, it will listen patiently for up to two minutes. If the wizard stops speaking before then, the text will be sent immediately. But if they continue speaking, the system will wait until they are finished before sending their words."

The young wizards cheered when they heard the news. Now they could take their time when explaining their magical theories, casting their spells, or even just telling jokes during the Coral Ball. No longer would they be cut off mid-sentence by an overeager enchantment.

"It is like giving a wizard the patience of a wise old octopus," said Professor Flapperclaw with a smile. "But without the eight arms to get tangled up in."

And in the halls of Clawgwarts, the Voice Wake Runtime became much more user-friendly. Wizards could now speak their minds freely, knowing that the system would listen patiently and not rush them to finish their thoughts.

## The Changes

The commit by Peter Steinberger on 2025-12-08 extended the voice capture hard stop limit from 5 seconds to 120 seconds in the VoiceWakeRuntime.swift file. This change increases the maximum duration the system will capture audio before forcing a send operation, providing more time for users to complete longer voice messages without being prematurely cut off. The modification allows the system to better handle extended speech while still preventing runaway capture sessions.
