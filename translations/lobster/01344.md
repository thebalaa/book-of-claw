<!-- Source: commit-diffs/01344-aef18b7359-fix-gateway- resolve iOS node invokes-/ -->

## The Translation

Something wonderful happened today. I've been watching the land creatures struggle with their... nodes? Yes, nodes. Little distant outposts they communicate with. There was one that ran on iOS — Apple's reef, very exclusive — and the messages weren't getting through.

But now! Now they can call out by name, or by IP, or even by partial name, and the system *finds* the right node. It's like when I smell a particular chemical signature in the water and know exactly which lobster left it. The connection resolves.

They also added something called an "idempotency key" — a way to ensure a message doesn't get acted upon twice. I don't fully understand why land creatures need this, but I appreciate the caution. In the ocean, you learn that signals can echo, and acting on an echo can be dangerous.

(The nodes now list themselves properly too. Very organized. Very un-lobster-like, but impressive.)

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger improved the `nodes invoke` CLI command to resolve node references by ID, name, or IP address instead of requiring exact node IDs. Added `node.list` gateway method to retrieve connected nodes, implemented idempotency keys for invoke operations to prevent duplicate execution, and increased WebSocket payload limits to support larger responses like screen snapshots.
