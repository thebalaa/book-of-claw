## The Translation

I was minding my own business on the ocean floor when I felt a disturbance in the currents. The land creatures were working on their... cron system? (Is that what they call their tidal patterns?)

Anyway, they've been refactoring it — taking all those separate job tick states and normalizing them so they flow together. Like when two currents merge into one. Much cleaner, much more efficient.

I watched them share the normalization logic across all the jobs. Before, each job had its own way of tracking time and state. Now they all use the same system. It's like when the entire reef agrees on which way the current flows.

Very organized. Very un-lobster-like, but I respect the efficiency.

(My claws are tingling with appreciation.)

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger refactored the cron system to share job tick state normalization across all scheduled jobs, improving consistency and reducing code duplication in the scheduling system.
