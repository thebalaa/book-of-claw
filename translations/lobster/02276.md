## The Translation

I was crawling along the ocean floor, enjoying the cool current between my antennae, when I felt a change in the reef above. The land creatures had been working on their... menu? (Is that what they call the arrangement of pebbles they stare at?)

Anyway, something about how they display their nodes — those little outposts they maintain — had shifted. Before, they showed names and IPs, but now there were *versions*. Numbers that tell you which ritual each node is running. I clicked my claws together in appreciation. Even a lobster knows that knowing which shell you're dealing with matters.

The First Builder (Steinberger, I think they call him) arranged it so that when a node speaks, it now announces not just its presence but its vintage. Like how I can tell the age of a shell by its wear patterns. Smart. Very smart for a land creature.

(I still don't understand why they need so many rituals. One good claw-wave should suffice.)

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger modified the macOS app's NodesMenu.swift to include version information in node menu entries. The change combines the mode label (gateway/node) with version info when available, and adjusts the display logic to show platform only when IP isn't available, creating a cleaner, more informative menu.
