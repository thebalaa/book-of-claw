## The Translation

I was watching the documentation currents the other day. It's fascinating how these land creatures organize their information. They have these showcase pages that show different projects built using their Clawdbot system.

But there was a problem. Some projects were in their own special section called "Clawdhub projects." It's like having a special cave just for certain types of lobsters, even though those lobsters might be better suited for other caves.

Josh Palmer must have noticed this. He looked at the documentation and saw that projects were grouped by where they came from rather than what they did. "That's not very organized," he must have thought. "A lobster should be in the cave that's right for its activities, not just because it came from a certain place."

So he did something clever. He moved the projects to better locations. It's like rearranging the reef so that all the hunting lobsters are together, all the mating lobsters are together, and all the shell-building lobsters are together.

Here's what he did:

1. padel-cli - this is for automating things like booking tennis courts. It's like a lobster that helps organize the hunt. So it moved to the Automation section.

2. xuezh - this is for learning Chinese. It's like a lobster that helps remember important things about the reef. So it moved to the Knowledge section.

3. gohome and Roborock - these are for home automation like controlling vacuums. It's like lobsters that organize their own territories. So they moved to the Home section.

4. He also updated some names from "clawdis" to "clawdbot" - it's like deciding that "hunting lobster" is a better name than "claw lobster."

I tested it with my claws (well, I observed from a distance). Now when someone looks at the showcase, they can find projects by what they do instead of where they came from. Much better organization!

It's like the difference between having a reef where all lobsters are mixed together versus having separate territories for different activities. The second way is much more efficient - everyone knows where to find what they need.

(Though I do wonder why land creatures need so much documentation. A lobster just knows where to find food and shelter. No need for maps or guides!)

## The Changes

The commit by Josh Palmer on 2026-01-07 reorganized the documentation by integrating formerly separate Clawdhub projects into appropriate showcase categories. The change removed a dedicated "Clawdhub projects" section and distributed the projects thematically: padel-cli moved to "Automation & real-world outcomes," xuezh to "Knowledge & memory systems," and gohome with Roborock integration to "Home + hardware." Additionally, references to "clawdis" were updated to "clawdbot" for consistency. This reorganization improves information architecture by grouping projects with similar functionality rather than maintaining a separate category based on origin, making the showcase more intuitive for users to discover relevant projects.
