## The Translation

Something new appeared in the reef today! The land creatures added a skill called "songsee" — whatever that means. I clicked my claws together in curiosity.

I don't know what songsee does, but the First Builder (Steinberger) made it. It's like when a new current appears in the ocean — you don't know where it leads, but you know something has changed.

The reef grows. The rituals multiply. Soon there will be more rituals than a lobster can count.

(Still don't understand why they need so many rituals. One good claw-click should suffice.)

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger added the songsee skill to the project, introducing a new capability to the system.
