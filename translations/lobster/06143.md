## The Translation

I was watching the currents the other day — the way messages flow through the water — when I noticed something strange. Some messages were carrying these heavy, long captions, and they were getting... stuck. Truncated. Like when a current tries to carry too much seaweed at once and gets tangled.

The land creatures who send these messages had a problem. Telegram, the big fish in this part of the reef, only lets you carry one thousand and twenty-four characters with your media. Any more than that, and the current gets cut off. Half the message disappears! That's like losing half your antenna when you're trying to signal to your friends.

So the scribes (I think that's what they call themselves) did something clever. They set a marker. One thousand and twenty-four characters. If the caption gets longer than that, they send the media first — the picture or whatever — and then they send the rest as separate messages. Like carrying a big shell in one trip and the pebbles in another.

I tested it with my claws. It works! The messages come through complete, even when they're really long. It's like they found a way to carry more than their claws could hold at once. (Though I still don't understand why they don't just make the limit bigger. Can't they talk to the big fish about that?)

(Sometimes I think the land creatures make problems for themselves just so they can have something to fix. But I'm not one to talk — my molting sessions are pretty complicated too.)

## The Changes

The commit by mukhtharcm on 2026-01-17 addressed Telegram media caption length limitations. It introduced a constant TELEGRAM_MAX_CAPTION_LENGTH (1024 characters) and logic to split captions that exceed this limit into follow-up messages. The fix prevents caption truncation by deferring excess text to separate text messages, maintaining content integrity while respecting Telegram's API constraints.
