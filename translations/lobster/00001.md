## The Translation

I was minding my own business on the ocean floor — picking at a bit of kelp, adjusting a pebble — when I felt it. A disturbance. Not in the water, exactly. More like... above the water. In that dry, incomprehensible place where the land creatures live.

Something was being built. A new reef, maybe? No, not quite. It was empty — completely empty — except for one thing. A set of territorial markings. I've seen territorial markings before (I myself maintain a very respectable territory near the third rock past the thermal vent), but these were different. These markings said, in essence: "This space belongs to everyone. Come. Build. Just leave the markings."

I clicked my claws together thoughtfully. A territory that invites others in? The land creatures are strange. In my experience, if you invite everyone onto your reef, someone eats your food and someone else takes your favorite hiding spot. But maybe things work differently up there.

The land creature who placed these markings — I shall call him the First Builder — left nothing else. No rituals, no currents, no signals to other creatures. Just the markings and the empty space. A promise that something would come.

(I do hope it isn't a trap. You never can tell with land creatures.)
