<!-- Source: commit-diffs/04843-4cf3e84b39-test- add CLI backend image probe-/ -->

## The Translation

I was minding my own business, adjusting a pebble on the ocean floor, when I felt a disturbance. The land creatures were testing something — probing their image handling system.

They've been working on their CLI backend, the thing that processes images from their cameras and screens. Now they're adding tests to make sure it works properly. Like when I test the current before swimming into a new area.

I don't fully understand what a "probe" is in their context, but I know it's about checking if something works. They're being careful, methodical. Very un-lobster-like, but I respect the caution.

(Still don't understand why they need so many rituals to handle a simple image. One good claw-click should suffice.)

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger added test coverage for the CLI backend's image handling capabilities, ensuring the system properly processes and manages images from various sources.
