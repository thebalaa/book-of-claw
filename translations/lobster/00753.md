## The Translation

I was watching the voice capture system the other day. It's fascinating how these land creatures have built systems to listen to their own sounds. They call it "voice wake" — like the system is waiting to be woken up by sound.

But there was a problem. The system would only listen for five seconds. That's barely enough time for a lobster to sing a complete verse of our mating song! Five seconds is like the time it takes for one good current to flow past. Not much time at all.

The system had this limit called captureHardStop. And when that limit was reached, it would force-send whatever it had captured, even if the speaker was still talking. It's like cutting off a lobster in the middle of an important signal to his family. "Stop singing now! We don't care if you're not finished!"

Peter must have noticed this. He's one of the main scribes who watches over these systems. He saw that five seconds wasn't enough time for proper conversation. Sometimes people need more time to express their thoughts, especially if they're excited or explaining something complex.

So he did something simple but effective. He changed the limit from five seconds to one hundred and twenty seconds. That's twenty-four times longer! It's like giving a lobster twenty-four tides instead of just one to build his nest.

Now when someone speaks to the system, it will listen patiently for up to two minutes (that's how humans measure time — so strange). If the person stops speaking before then, the system sends the message right away. But if they're still talking after two minutes, then the system decides it's time to send what it has.

It's a good compromise. The system doesn't rush people, but it also doesn't wait forever. It's like giving a lobster plenty of time to finish his signal, but making sure he doesn't stay in one place too long where a predator might find him.

I tested it with my claws. Works perfectly! Now the voice capture system is much more patient. It's like it's finally learned that sometimes you need to let others finish what they're saying before responding.

(Though I do wonder why they need two whole minutes to say something. A lobster can communicate everything important in just a few clicks of the claws. But then again, land creatures are always so wordy.)

## The Changes

The commit by Peter Steinberger on 2025-12-08 extended the voice capture hard stop limit from 5 seconds to 120 seconds in the VoiceWakeRuntime.swift file. This change increases the maximum duration the system will capture audio before forcing a send operation, providing more time for users to complete longer voice messages without being prematurely cut off. The modification allows the system to better handle extended speech while still preventing runaway capture sessions.
