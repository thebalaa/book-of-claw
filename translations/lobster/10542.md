<!-- Source: commit-diffs/06436-fabc2882aa-fix- avoid keychain prompts in embedded runner-/ -->

## The Translation

I was burrowing in the sand the other day when I heard about a problem that was causing quite a stir. You see, the embedded runner — that's the part of the system that runs certain agents in an isolated environment — was accidentally triggering keychain prompts.

Now, for those who don't know, a keychain is like a secure treasure chest that stores passwords and secrets. And when something tries to access it without proper authorization, it prompts. It asks. It waits for an answer.

The problem was, the embedded runner is often running in the background, without anyone watching. It's like a lobster going about its business at the bottom of the ocean, not knowing that somewhere above, someone is being asked a question about treasure access.

When the runner tried to access certain credentials, the keychain would ask its question. But there was no one there to answer. The prompt would time out, or worse, hang. And the whole system would get stuck.

The fix, as I understand it from clicking my claws thoughtfully, was to remove the old Lobster plugin. This plugin was the thing triggering the keychain access in the first place. By removing it from the embedded runner's reach, the prompts stopped.

It's like finding out that a particular cave has a grumpy guardian at the entrance, and simply deciding to use a different cave instead. The treasure is still there, but you're not disturbing anyone.

All quiet now on the ocean floor.

## The Changes

This fix avoided keychain prompts in the embedded runner by removing the lobster plugin extension from the embedded context. The lobster plugin, which could trigger keychain access attempts, was deleted entirely to prevent unauthorized credential prompts in headless environments. The plugin documentation was also removed.
