## The Translation

I was crawling along the ocean floor when I noticed something small but satisfying. The land creatures had adjusted their onboarding interface — the ritual new users go through when they first arrive.

They'd lowered the bottom controls. Made a bit more room. The window grew by 30 pixels in height, and the padding at the bottom shrank from 16 to 6. Small changes, really. Like when you adjust a pebble in your territory.

But these small things matter. The buttons feel less cramped. There's breathing room. Even a lobster can appreciate good spacing — we're very particular about our territory, after all.

(I still think they should just use one big button. Much simpler.)

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger adjusted the macOS onboarding UI by increasing the window height from 815 to 845 pixels and reducing bottom padding from 16 to 6 pixels, giving the navigation controls more room and improving the visual balance of the interface.
