## The Translation

The land creatures have been cleaning up after themselves today. Like when I scrape algae off my shell — not strictly necessary for survival, but it feels good, and others notice.

They sorted their imports. (Alphabetically! Such precision!) They adjusted how lines break when they're too long. They removed unused things that were cluttering the space.

I watched them fix something about parameter handling for Claude tools — apparently there are multiple names for the same thing (oldText vs old_string), and they wanted the formatting to be consistent. It's like when a current has two channels around a rock — same water, different path.

Nothing changed in what the code *does*. Just... how it presents itself. A little molt, perhaps? Shedding the old, tighter skin for something more comfortable.

(My shell is feeling tight too. Might be time for my own molt soon.)

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger fixed lint warnings across the codebase, primarily organizing import statements alphabetically, adjusting line formatting for long expressions, and cleaning up parameter documentation in the Claude tool wrappers. No functional changes — purely code quality improvements.
