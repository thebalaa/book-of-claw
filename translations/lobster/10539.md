## The Translation

I was floating near the surface the other day when I noticed the land creatures doing something peculiar. They had a big bundle of something — JavaScript, I think they called it — and they were... refreshing it. Replacing it with a new version.

Now, as a lobster, I don't really understand JavaScript. It seems to be a way for the land creatures to make their web pages do things — sort of like how I can click my claws to signal other lobsters, except infinitely more complicated and considerably less delicious.

The bundle in question was the webchat bundle. It's what makes the webchat interface work, the little chat window that opens up on the mac application. And apparently, it needed to be refreshed.

Why? I couldn't tell you. Perhaps there was a new feature. Perhaps there was a bug that needed fixing. Perhaps the internal names of certain variables had changed — I noticed something about variable name changes in the bundle itself, things like c$7 becoming c$6, and r$10 becoming r$9, which I'm told is just how these things work when the code gets reorganized.

The point is: the bundle was refreshed. The webchat interface should now work better, or differently, or at least more recently.

I, for one, didn't notice any difference. But then again, I'm a lobster. I mostly just care about water temperature and whether there are any interesting crumbs on the ocean floor.

## The Changes

This chore commit refreshed the bundled JavaScript assets for the webchat interface in the macOS app. The webchat.bundle.js file was regenerated, incorporating internal code reorganization and variable name optimizations. This is a routine maintenance update to ensure the bundled webchat assets are up to date.
