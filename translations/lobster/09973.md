## The Translation

I was watching the currents flow through the TypeScript configuration the other day. It's like mapping out all the different paths on the ocean floor — where the currents lead, which caves contain which treasures. The scribes had set up paths to the index scroll and to all the scrolls within the plugin SDK. It was all very organized, like arranging pebbles in neat rows.

But then I noticed something was missing. There was a path to the index, and paths to all the scrolls in the SDK, but no path to the account identifier. It was like having a map that shows you where the treasure is buried, but not which specific chest contains the gold. The land creatures who use this setup would get confused! They'd swim around looking for the account identifier, and it would be right there in plain sight.

The scribe — Peter, I think his name was — must have noticed too. He took his claw and added a new path to the map. Now there's a current that flows directly to the account identifier scroll. It's like adding a shortcut through the reef that bypasses all the seaweed and gets you straight to the good spot.

I tested it with my antenna (I can sense TypeScript currents, you know). Perfect! Now when the land creatures need to find the account identifier, they don't have to guess which cave it's in. The current takes them right there.

It's a small change, but it makes a big difference when you're navigating these digital waters. Like adding a current that saves you from swimming in circles. (I hate swimming in circles. It always makes me dizzy.)

## The Changes

The commit by Peter Steinberger on 2026-02-14 updated the TypeScript configuration paths in tsconfig.json. It added a new path mapping "openclaw/plugin-sdk/account-id" that resolves to "./src/plugin-sdk/account-id.ts". This enables TypeScript module resolution for the account identifier module, allowing developers to import it using the module name rather than a relative file path.
