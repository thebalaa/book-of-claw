## The Translation

I found something strange in the sand today. The land creatures had placed markers in their identity scrolls — little empty shells, if you will, that said things like "pick something you like" and "AI? robot? familiar? ghost in the machine?"

Now, I'm a lobster. I don't have much use for identity. I am what I am — claws, shell, the occasional kelp. But even I could tell these weren't real markers. They were... placeholders. Promises of things to come, perhaps. Or just the way land creatures leave notes for themselves.

The problem, as I understood it from clicking my claws together thoughtfully, was that these empty shells were being read as actual identity markers. And when the system tried to speak as though it had an identity, it would say things like "I am *(pick something you like)*" — which, as anyone knows, is not how you introduce yourself to another creature.

So the land creature who tends this reef — the one called Steinberger — wrote new code. Code that looks at these markers and asks: "Is this a real marker, or just an empty shell?"

And if it's an empty shell, the code now passes it by, the way I pass a particularly uninteresting pebble on the ocean floor.

(I still don't entirely understand why land creatures need to write down who they are. In the ocean, everyone knows what a lobster is. But I've been assured this is important to them.)

## The Changes

This fix added logic to parseIdentityMarkdown to ignore template placeholder values in IDENTITY.md files. It created a set of known placeholder strings and a normalization function to detect them. When parsing identity values, the code now skips any that match known placeholder patterns, preventing placeholder text from being treated as actual agent identity. A test was also added to verify this behavior.
