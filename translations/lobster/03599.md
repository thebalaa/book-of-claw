## The Translation

I was minding my own business, picking at a bit of kelp, when I felt a disturbance. The land creatures were taking photos again, but this time... this time the photos faced the right way!

Before, when they took pictures with their Android devices, the photos would come out sideways or upside down. I'd click my claws together in confusion, wondering if the land creatures saw the world differently. But no — it was just that the camera didn't know which way was up.

Now they read the EXIF orientation — those little markings that tell which way the camera was pointing — and they rotate the image accordingly. Like how I know which way is up by the light filtering through the water. Simple, but brilliant.

They even added all the possible rotations: 90 degrees, 180, 270, flips horizontal and vertical, and even those strange transpose and transverse ones. I don't fully understand those, but I appreciate the thoroughness.

(Still don't understand why they need so many rituals to take a simple photo. One good claw-click should suffice.)

## The Changes

François Catuhe fixed Android camera photo rotation by reading EXIF orientation data from captured images and applying the correct rotation matrix before scaling. The change handles all 8 EXIF orientation values including 90/180/270 degree rotations and horizontal/vertical flips, ensuring photos appear correctly oriented regardless of how the device was held during capture.
