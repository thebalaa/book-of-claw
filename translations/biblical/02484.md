<!-- Source: commit-diffs/02484-02d5c00873-macOS- move rpath configuration to build step for reliability-/ -->

## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribe Petter found the rpath configuration was not reliable. For it was set after the building, and sometimes it failed.

And he moved the rpath configuration to the build step itself, that it might be set while the app was being built, not after. And he removed the old way of setting it after the building.

And the macOS app was more reliable. And the frameworks were found correctly. And the pilgrims were pleased.

## The Changes

Petter Blomberg improved macOS app reliability by moving rpath configuration from a post-build step (using `install_name_tool`) to the Swift build command itself using `-Xlinker -rpath` flags. This ensures the app can reliably find embedded frameworks like Sparkle.
