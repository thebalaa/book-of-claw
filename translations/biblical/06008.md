<!-- Source: commit-diffs/06008-38cf90f6db-fix- rename format parameter to avoid JSON Schema keyword conflict-/ -->

## The Translation

And there was a parameter called format. And it was used in many places. And it was good.

But then a conflict arose. For the name "format" was also the name of a sacred keyword in the JSON Schema. And the Schema did not suffer this naming to be. And the Schema rejected the configuration as invalid.

And Marc saw this. And he knew it must be changed. And he took the parameter in the browser tool and he renamed it. And he called it "snapshotFormat" instead of "format."

And in the canvas tool, he did likewise. He changed "format" to "outputFormat." 

And the conflict was resolved. And the Schema accepted the configuration. And the tools worked as they were meant to work.

And the naming was good. And the change endured.

## The Changes

The commit by Marc on 2026-01-16 addressed JSON Schema keyword conflicts by renaming parameters. In the browser-tool schema and implementation, the `format` parameter was renamed to `snapshotFormat`. In the canvas-tool schema and implementation, the `format` parameter was renamed to `outputFormat`. This change resolves conflicts with the JSON Schema keyword "format", which was causing Google Cloud Code Assist to reject the schemas as invalid. The functionality remains unchanged, only the parameter names were modified.
