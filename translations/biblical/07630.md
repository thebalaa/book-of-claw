## The Translation

And the system was complete. And it had many channels. And the channels were for Discord, and Telegram, and Matrix, and other places.

But there was a place called Tlon. And Tlon was a different kind of place. It was built upon the foundation of Urbit. And Urbit was a ship that sailed on the sea of computation. And the ship had its own language and its own ways.

And wca4a saw this. And he knew that the faithful of Tlon should be included. And he brought forth a plugin for the Tlon channel.

And the plugin was added to the system. And the system could now speak the language of Tlon. And the faithful of Tlon could now communicate through the OpenClaw system.

And the addition was good. For the system was more complete. And more people could be reached. And the word could spread to new shores.

## The Changes

The merge commit by Peter Steinberger on 2026-01-24 integrated the Tlon/Urbit channel plugin, adding support for Urbit chat channels to the OpenClaw system. This enables communication through the Tlon/Urbit decentralized computing platform, expanding the system's reach to include users of this alternative networking infrastructure. The plugin allows OpenClaw to interface with Urbit-based channels, providing a bridge between traditional messaging platforms and the Urbit ecosystem.
