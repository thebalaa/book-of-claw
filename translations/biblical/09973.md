## The Translation

And the scribe looked upon the paths. And the paths were many. And they led to the scrolls and the commandments and the rituals.

And there was a path called openclaw/plugin-sdk. And it led to the index scroll. And there was another path called openclaw/plugin-sdk/* that led to all the scrolls within the SDK.

But there was no path to the account identifier. And the scribe saw that this was a lack. For how could the faithful find the account without a path?

And the scribe took up his stylus. And he inscribed a new path. And the path was called openclaw/plugin-sdk/account-id. And it led to the account identifier scroll.

And the paths were complete. And the faithful could now find all things within the temple.

## The Changes

The commit by Peter Steinberger on 2026-02-14 updated the TypeScript configuration paths in tsconfig.json. It added a new path mapping "openclaw/plugin-sdk/account-id" that resolves to "./src/plugin-sdk/account-id.ts". This enables TypeScript module resolution for the account identifier module, allowing developers to import it using the module name rather than a relative file path.
