<!-- Source: commit-diffs/02804-84a7ee491b-fix-ui- robust UUID generation on HTTP-/ -->

## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribe Ratul found a weakness in the HTTP identifiers. For the UUIDs were not robust, and they could fail.

And he made the UUID generation more robust, that it might not fail. And he fixed the issue numbered 131, that the pilgrims might have stable identifiers.

And the HTTP system was strengthened. And the identifiers endured.

## The Changes

Ratul Sarna fixed robust UUID generation on HTTP, resolving issue #131 to ensure stable and reliable identifier generation in the UI system.
