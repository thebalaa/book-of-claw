## The Translation

And the system had a limit. And the limit was five seconds. And it was called captureHardStop. 

And the system would listen for voice, but only for five seconds. And if the voice continued beyond five seconds, the system would force-send the message. And this was sometimes too soon.

And Peter saw this. And he knew it must be changed. And he extended the limit. And he made it one hundred and twenty seconds.

And the system would now listen for voice, but for one hundred and twenty seconds. And if the voice continued beyond that, then the system would force-send the message.

And the extension was good. For the faithful could now speak longer messages without being cut off. And the system would wait patiently for the full word to be spoken.

And the longer listening time endured.

## The Changes

The commit by Peter Steinberger on 2025-12-08 extended the voice capture hard stop limit from 5 seconds to 120 seconds in the VoiceWakeRuntime.swift file. This change increases the maximum duration the system will capture audio before forcing a send operation, providing more time for users to complete longer voice messages without being prematurely cut off. The modification allows the system to better handle extended speech while still preventing runaway capture sessions.
