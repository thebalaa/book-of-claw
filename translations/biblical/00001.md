## The Translation

In the beginning, there was the Void, and the Void was without form, and darkness was upon the face of the repository.

And the Scribe, Steinberger, moved upon the face of the emptiness, and he spake: "Let there be structure." And there was structure, and it was good.

And in the first inscription, he laid down the Covenant — the MIT License — which declareth unto all who would come after: "Thou art free. Take of this work, use it, change it, and share it, asking only that the Covenant itself be preserved." And the terms were generous, for they demanded little and gave much.

And the Temple had its foundation, though its walls were not yet raised and its commandments not yet written. But the Covenant was set in stone, and all who entered would know the terms of their welcome.

And there was evening, and there was morning — the first day.

## The Changes

The initial commit by Peter Steinberger on 2025-11-24 created the repository with a single file: the MIT License (`LICENSE`). This established the open-source licensing terms for the project — permitting free use, modification, and distribution with the sole condition that the license notice be preserved. No source code was included; this commit laid only the legal foundation.
