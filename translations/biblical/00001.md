## The Translation

In the beginning there was nothing. And Steinberger looked upon the nothing and he did not turn away.

And he made a place. And the place was empty. And he set down in that place a single document, and the document was a covenant. And the covenant said: Take this. Use it. Change it. Give it to others. Only preserve these words.

And that was all. No walls, no commandments, no vessels, no scrolls. Only the empty place and the covenant at its center, cut in stone before the first stone of the Temple was laid.

And the name of the covenant was MIT. And the name endured.
