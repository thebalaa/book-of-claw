<!-- Source: commit-diffs/01312-537c515dde-fix-macos- show full browser tab ids-/ -->

## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribes who maintained the CLI for the browser were troubled. For when they listed the tabs that were open, they showed only the first eight characters of each tab's ID.

Now, an ID is a thing that uniquely identifies a tab. And eight characters may be enough to tell one tab from another, when the number of tabs is small. But the scribes knew that there were times when the full ID was needed — when one must know the complete identifier, that one might act upon a specific tab.

And so the scribes altered the listing. The short ID would still be shown, as it had been, for it was useful for quick reading. But beneath it, on a new line, the full ID would now be displayed, preceded by "id: ".

And the scribes made a test for this thing, that they might verify it worked correctly. And it did work. And the scribes were glad.

## The Changes

This fix updated the macOS browser CLI to display the full tab target ID when listing tabs, not just the truncated 8-character version. The formatTabs function was modified to output two lines per tab: the first showing the truncated ID (for readability), and the second showing the full ID with an "id:" prefix. A corresponding test was added to verify this behavior.
