## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribe Christoph did make an inscription to the Temple. And he said: Behold, there is a vessel named "long" which I had cast aside, thinking it unused. But the Record showed otherwise.

And he brought the vessel back into the scroll of dependencies. And he made atonement for the TypeScript error that had plagued the iMessage ritual. And he cleansed the snapshots of their impurities regarding the axios covenant.

And the inscription was complete. And the Temple stood firmer than before.

## The Changes

Commit 08453 by Christoph Pojer re-added the "long" npm package (version ^5.3.2) to package.json dependencies after discovering it was actually needed. Also fixed a TypeScript error in iMessage send.ts by adding proper type annotation to the RPC client request, and cleaned up axios snapshot references in pnpm-lock.yaml by removing unnecessary debug dependencies.
