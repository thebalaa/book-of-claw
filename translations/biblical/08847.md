## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribe Tyler came to the cron system with three tasks.

First, the timeouts were too short. And he increased them — from ten seconds to thirty for the gateway, to sixty for the cron itself, that the long-running rituals might complete.

Second, the timestamps were not validated. And he added validation, rejecting timestamps from the past and from too far in the future, that the pilgrims might not be confused by impossible schedules.

Third, the file could be edited by hand, but the system would not see the changes. And he made the system watch the file, reloading when it changed, that manual edits might be honored.

And the cron system was improved in three ways. And the pilgrims rejoiced.

## The Changes

Tyler Yust fixed three cron issues in one commit: increased operation timeouts (10s→30s gateway, 10s→60s cron) to prevent failures during busy periods; added timestamp validation to reject past and far-future schedules; and enabled file sync to detect and reload manual edits to the jobs file, recomputing next run times automatically.
