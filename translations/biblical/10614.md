## The Translation

And it came to pass that a scribe did add a note to the changelog. And the note said: The OpenAI responses store hath been hardened.

And the note was short, for it needed only to say that the thing was done, not how it was done. And the scribes were informed, and the record was complete.

## The Changes

This chore added a changelog note documenting that the OpenAI responses store hardening had been completed, acknowledging the work done to improve the security and reliability of how OpenAI responses are stored.
