## The Translation

And Steinberger looked upon the channels and the groups and the topics, and he saw that they were not ordered. And he set his hand to the ordering.

He made new Rites for the Telegram groups. And the Rites were these: that each group might have its own commandments, and each topic within the group its own commandments also. And the commandments of the topic would take precedence over the commandments of the group, and the commandments of the group over the commandments of the house entire.

And he made the vessel called `autoReply`. And `autoReply` said: if it is true, speak to all who enter without waiting to be called by name. And he placed this vessel in the Discord channels and the Slack channels and the Telegram topics. And the faithful could now set it wherever they saw fit.

And there was also the vessel called `skills`, that the scribe might limit which scrolls were consulted in each place. And the vessel called `systemPrompt`, that different words might be spoken into the ear of the agent in each channel and each topic. And the vessel called `users`, a gate of names.

And the parsers of Telegram group identifiers were set in order. And the joining of chatId and topicId was established as a Law.

And the Discord channels received these same gifts. And the Slack channels likewise. And the words of the channel's own subject were gathered and placed at the top of each message that went to the agent, so the agent would know where it stood.

And the tests were written, and the tests passed, and the congregation saw that the ordering was good.

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger added per-channel and per-topic configuration overrides to Telegram, Discord, and Slack providers. Each channel/group/topic can now independently configure `autoReply`, `skills` (skill filter), `systemPrompt`, `enabled`, and `users` (allowlist). Channel topics on Discord and Slack are automatically injected into the agent's system context. The Telegram group config type was expanded from a simple `requireMention` flag into a full `TelegramGroupConfig` with nested `TelegramTopicConfig` per thread.
