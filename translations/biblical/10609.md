## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribe Vignesh found a voice in the silence. For when the agent spoke through the message tool, it would still say "NO_REPLY" at the end, and the pilgrims were confused.

And he made the silence speak. For when the message tool had already delivered the words, the final "NO_REPLY" would be replaced with those words, that the record might be complete.

And he wrote trials to ensure the silence spoke correctly. And the pilgrims were no longer confused by the silence that followed speech.

## The Changes

Vignesh Natarajan fixed the agent message handling to suppress "NO_REPLY" text when the message tool has already sent text. The `resolveSilentReplyFallbackText` function now mirrors the last messaging tool text instead of showing the silent reply token, improving clarity in message logs and responses.
