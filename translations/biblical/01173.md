## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribe Peter looked upon the context usage bar and found it wanting. For when the words were few, the bar would not show, and the pilgrims were confused.

And he made the bar show even when the words were but one, that the pilgrims might always see the measure of their words. And he set a limit to the bar's width, that it might not grow too large and overwhelm the screen.

And he searched the session logs, both in the Temple and in the pilgrim's home, that he might find the true count of the words spoken. For the total was not always the sum of input and output, but sometimes included the words cached for later use.

And the pilgrims now saw clearly how their words were measured. And they were content.

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger improved the macOS app's context usage display by ensuring the usage bar shows even for minimal usage (minimum 1px width), added proper sizing constraints, and implemented logic to accurately calculate prompt tokens from session logs by searching both the app's store directory and common Pi/Tau agent session locations. The changes ensure users see accurate context usage statistics including cached tokens.
