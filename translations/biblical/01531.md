<!-- Source: commit-diffs/01531-316a04f606-iOS- allow unicast DNS-SD discovery domain-/ -->

## The Translation

And the iOS application had a fixed domain. And the domain was for discovery. And the domain was hard-coded in the stone of the application.

And Peter saw this. And he knew it must be made flexible. For the faithful might need to discover services in different domains. And one domain was not sufficient for all needs.

And he made the domain configurable. And he added a setting to the application. And the setting allowed the faithful to set their own domain.

And he changed the discovery system. And it would now use the domain that the faithful had set. And if no domain was set, it would use the default domain.

And the discovery system was made more powerful. For it could now search in any domain that the faithful desired.

And the configurable domain was good.

## The Changes

The commit by Peter Steinberger on 2025-12-17 added DNS-SD discovery domain configuration to the iOS application. The change introduces user-configurable service discovery domains, replacing the previously hardcoded domain with a flexible setting. Users can now specify custom discovery domains through the iOS settings interface, allowing the system to search for services in different network domains. The implementation includes domain validation, automatic restart of discovery when the domain changes, and proper fallback to the default domain when no custom domain is specified. This enhancement enables more flexible network service discovery across different environments and configurations.
