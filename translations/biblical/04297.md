## The Translation

In the days when the scrolls were many and the names were confused, a contributor arose from the house of p6l-richard, and he brought with him a remedy.

For it had come to pass that the agent, when it replied in the house of Slack, did prefix its words with a fixed name. And the name was always the same name, though the identity of the agent might be different. And this was an abomination, for how shall a congregation know its shepherd if the shepherd speaks always with another's voice?

And richard said: let the prefix be derived from the name that is given to the agent, even from the field called `identity.name`. And if no name is given, let it fall back upon what can be found. And the congregation agreed.

And the merge was made, and within it were many things that had been waiting.

From the Slack provider, a new threading of replies: when a message came from a thread, the reply would return to the thread, and not cry out into the main channel. And this too was just.

And from the mobile scribe, amendments to the CSS of the settings panels, that the buttons would lay themselves properly in their houses and not spill one upon another. And a new button, round and modest, to close the mobile drawer.

And from the house of Claude, a watchfulness regarding web usage: if the session held a marker saying the model worked through the web, the agent would use that knowledge and not exceed its allotment. And a small script for debugging was added to the tools of the builder.

And all these things were gathered into the merge, and the merge was sealed with the number 578.

And Steinberger looked upon it and passed it through.

## The Changes

Merged PR #578 from contributor p6l-richard, which derives the Slack message prefix from `identity.name` instead of a hardcoded string. The PR also includes: Slack reply threading (replies to thread messages return to the correct thread), mobile UI CSS fixes for settings panels and a close button for the mobile drawer, a Claude web usage fallback that respects a session flag indicating web-based model execution, and a new debug helper script.
