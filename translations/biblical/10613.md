## The Translation

And the scribe did look upon the deliver scroll and saw that there was a blank line where no blank line should be. And the scribe was troubled, for even the smallest blemish in the code is as a crack in the foundation.

And the scribe removed the blank line. And it was gone. And there was unity in the formatting, for the scroll was smoother than before.

And the Temple endured.

## The Changes

This refactor unified the markdown formatting pipeline by removing an extra blank line in the deliver.ts file, creating a more consistent code structure.
