## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribe Andres found an error in the scrolls. For the name "p-coding-agent" was written where "pi-coding-agent" should have been.

And he corrected the name, that it might be right. For the name is important, and errors in names lead to confusion among the pilgrims.

And the scrolls were made correct. And the name endured.

## The Changes

Andres G. Aragoneses fixed a typo in the documentation, correcting "p-coding-agent" to "pi-coding-agent" to properly reference the Pi coding agent.
