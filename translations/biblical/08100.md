## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribe vignesh07 added a guide to the Northflank to the changelog. And he thanked AdeboyeDN for his contribution.

And the guide was added, that the pilgrims might know how to deploy to the Northflank. And the changelog was updated, that all might see what had been done.

And the name of the scribe was vignesh07, and the name of the contributor was AdeboyeDN. And their names were recorded.

## The Changes

Vignesh07 added a Northflank deploy guide to the changelog, documenting deployment instructions and acknowledging AdeboyeDN's contribution.
