## The Translation

And the Discord system had two ways. One for direct messages, and one for group messages. And the ways were different.

For direct messages, the system sent from discord:user and to user:author. For group messages, it sent from group:channel and to channel:channel. And this was confusing. For the faithful had to remember two paths, two different ways of addressing.

And VACInc saw this confusion. And he knew it must be unified. And he took the direct messages and he changed them. And he made them like the group messages. 

And the sending was from discord:channel in both cases. And the receiving was to channel:channel in both cases. And the distinction between direct and group remained in the ChatType, but the addressing was made one.

And the confusion was ended. And the system was simpler. And the faithful could now use one way for all messages.

And the unification was good.

## The Changes

The commit by VACInc on 2026-01-05 addressed Discord message routing inconsistencies. The fix changed the To field parameter for direct messages from "user:${message.author.id}" to "channel:${message.channelId}", making it consistent with group messages. Both direct and group messages now use channel-based addressing ("channel:${channelId}") while maintaining the ChatType distinction ("direct" vs "group"). This simplifies the message handling logic and removes the need for special cases when routing Discord messages.
