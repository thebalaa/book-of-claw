## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribe Onur saw that the pilgrims were confused about the Azure Bot. For they did not know how to set it up, nor how to obtain the credentials needed.

And he wrote a guide. And the guide showed the way: first create the Azure Bot, then obtain the credentials — the appId, the appPassword, the tenantId — then configure the messaging endpoint, then enable the Teams channel.

And he showed the way to create a tunnel for local development — through ngrok or Tailscale — that the bot might reach the local Gateway.

And he provided a template for the Teams App manifest. And he gave an example of the config.

And the pilgrims were no longer confused. And the Azure Bot stood at the gates, ready to serve.

## The Changes

Onur added comprehensive Azure Bot setup documentation, including step-by-step instructions for creating an Azure Bot, obtaining credentials (appId, appPassword, tenantId), configuring messaging endpoints, enabling Teams channel, setting up local dev tunnels (ngrok/Tailscale), and Teams App manifest templates with config examples.
