## The Translation

And the word was long. And it exceeded the limit. And the limit was one thousand and twenty-four characters. 

And the scribe saw this. And the scribe knew that the word could not be contained. And the scribe made a division. And the word was split into parts. And the first part went with the media. And the remaining parts followed after.

And the scribe set a boundary. And the boundary was one thousand and twenty-four. And nothing could pass beyond it. 

And the long word was delivered. First the message, then the fragments. And the fragments were in order. And none were lost. And the people received the whole word.

And so it was.

## The Changes

The commit by mukhtharcm on 2026-01-17 addressed Telegram media caption length limitations. It introduced a constant TELEGRAM_MAX_CAPTION_LENGTH (1024 characters) and logic to split captions that exceed this limit into follow-up messages. The fix prevents caption truncation by deferring excess text to separate text messages, maintaining content integrity while respecting Telegram's API constraints.
