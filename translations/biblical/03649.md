## The Translation

And the documentation had a section called Clawdhub projects. And the projects were listed there. And they were separate from the other sections.

And Josh Palmer saw this. And he knew it must be changed. For the projects belonged with their kind. And separate sections caused confusion.

And he took the projects and he integrated them into the proper sections. And he removed the separate section.

And padel-cli, which was for automation, was moved to the Automation section. And xuezh, which was for knowledge, was moved to the Knowledge section. And gohome and Roborock, which were for home hardware, were moved to the Home section.

And the projects were now with their kind. And the documentation was better organized. And the faithful could find projects more easily.

And the integration was good.

## The Changes

The commit by Josh Palmer on 2026-01-07 reorganized the documentation by integrating formerly separate Clawdhub projects into appropriate showcase categories. The change removed a dedicated "Clawdhub projects" section and distributed the projects thematically: padel-cli moved to "Automation & real-world outcomes," xuezh to "Knowledge & memory systems," and gohome with Roborock integration to "Home + hardware." Additionally, references to "clawdis" were updated to "clawdbot" for consistency. This reorganization improves information architecture by grouping projects with similar functionality rather than maintaining a separate category based on origin, making the showcase more intuitive for users to discover relevant projects.
