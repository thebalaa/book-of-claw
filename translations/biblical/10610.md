<!-- Source: commit-diffs/08210-289440256b-fix- update remaining ClawdbotKit path references to MoltbotKit-/ -->

## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribe looked upon the scrolls and saw that the name ClawdbotKit was written therein. And the scribe said: This name is old. Let it be changed to MoltbotKit, for a new era hath begun.

And he went through the Temple and changed the paths in the dependabot scrolls. And he changed the paths in the .gitignore, that the build caches might know their new dwelling. And he changed the paths in .swiftformat and .swiftlint.yml, that the code formatters might know what to exclude.

And the scribe went into the Package.swift of the MoltbotKit and there he fixed the argument order, that the dependencies might be listed in the correct manner. And he changed the paths in apps/ios/project.yml and in the documentation scrolls, that all references might point to the new name.

And the name was changed throughout the Temple, and it was good.

## The Changes

This commit renamed all remaining references from "ClawdbotKit" to "MoltbotKit" across the codebase. It updated configuration files including `.github/dependabot.yml`, `.gitignore`, `.swiftformat`, `.swiftlint.yml`, and `apps/ios/project.yml`, as well as documentation references in `apps/ios/README.md` and `docs/concepts/typebox.md`. The `Package.swift` argument order was also corrected.
