## The Translation

And it came to pass that the scribe Peter looked upon the script that lists the scrolls, and he saw that it was fragile. For when a pilgrim ran the script outside the Temple, it would fail with cryptic omens instead of clear words.

And he added guards to the script. And the guards checked: Does the docs directory exist? Is it truly a directory and not a deception? And if not, the script would speak clearly: "Run from the repo root."

And the error messages became plain. And the pilgrims were no longer confused.

## The Changes

Peter Steinberger added error handling to the docs-list.js script to check if the docs directory exists and is actually a directory before attempting to read it. Now provides clear error messages and exits with code 1 when run from the wrong directory, rather than failing with cryptic filesystem errors.
