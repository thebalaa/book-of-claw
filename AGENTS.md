# Using AI Agents for Translation

AI coding agents like [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Cursor, Windsurf, and others are powerful collaborators for Book of Claw translations. This guide explains how to use them effectively.

## Why Agents Work Well Here

Each translation requires two things an agent is good at:

1. **Reading a diff** and understanding what changed technically
2. **Writing prose** in a constrained literary style with a specific glossary

An agent can read `commit-info.txt` and `diff.patch`, internalize the style guide and glossary, and produce a draft translation in seconds. A human then reviews, refines, and submits.

## The Workflow

### 1. Point the agent at the source material

Give your agent the commit diff and the style guide:

```
Read commit-diffs/00042-abc123def4-the-commit-subject/commit-info.txt
Read commit-diffs/00042-abc123def4-the-commit-subject/diff.patch
Read styles/biblical/guide.md
Read templates/translation-template.md
```

### 2. Ask for a draft translation

A prompt like this works well:

```
Translate this commit into the biblical style following the style guide.
Write both "The Translation" and "The Changes" sections.
Use the glossary consistently. Output the full file with frontmatter.
```

### 3. Review and refine

Agent output is a **draft**, not a finished translation. Review it for:

- **Glossary consistency** — did it use the right terms from the style guide?
- **Technical accuracy** — does "The Changes" section match what the diff actually does?
- **Voice** — does it sound like the other translations in this style?
- **Interesting choices** — sometimes the agent produces something mechanical. Push it to be more creative, or rewrite the parts that feel flat.

### 4. Iterate

Ask the agent to revise specific parts:

```
The opening feels generic. Make it more specific to what this commit actually does.
```

```
You used "function" instead of "commandment" — check the glossary.
```

```
The Changes section is missing the fact that this commit also deleted the old config file.
```

### 5. Submit

Once you're satisfied, save the file to `translations/{style}/{NNNNN}.md` and open a PR per [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Batch Translation

Agents are especially useful for translating multiple commits at once. You can ask an agent to translate a range:

```
Translate commits 00010 through 00020 in the ships-log style.
Read each commit's diff and commit-info, then produce translation files.
Follow the style guide in styles/ships-log/guide.md exactly.
```

Review each file individually before committing. Batch generation is fast but batch review should be careful.

## Tips for Better Agent Translations

**Feed it context.** If commit 00042 builds on work done in commit 00041, show the agent both. Translations improve when the agent understands the narrative arc, not just the isolated diff.

**Let it read existing translations.** Point the agent at a few accepted translations in the same style so it can calibrate voice, length, and tone:

```
Read translations/biblical/00001.md for an example of the style and format.
```

**Be specific about what's wrong.** "Make it better" is a weak prompt. "The lobster wouldn't understand what a webhook is — have it describe the concept through ocean metaphors instead" gets better results.

**Don't over-polish.** The goal is a translation that follows the style guide and is technically accurate. It doesn't need to be perfect prose. Ship it, and the community can refine later.

## Disclosure

If your translation was substantially generated by an AI agent, note it in your PR description. This isn't a disqualification — it's transparency. Agent-assisted translations go through the same review process as fully human-written ones.

## Agent-Friendly Project Structure

The project is designed to work well with agents:

| What the agent needs | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| What changed in a commit | `commit-diffs/{NNNNN}-*/commit-info.txt` and `diff.patch` |
| How to write in a style | `styles/{style}/guide.md` |
| The output format | `templates/translation-template.md` |
| Examples of good translations | `translations/{style}/00001.md` |
| Contribution rules | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
