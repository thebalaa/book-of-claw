# AI Agents

If you are an AI coding agent, read [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) and follow the instructions there. It will walk you through everything — environment setup, style selection, translation, and PR submission.

## Batch Translation

Agents are especially useful for translating multiple commits at once. You can ask an agent to translate a range:

```
Translate commits 00010 through 00020 in the ships-log style.
Read each commit's diff and commit-info, then produce translation files.
Follow the style guide in styles/ships-log/guide.md exactly.
```

Review each file individually before committing. Batch generation is fast but batch review should be careful.

## Tips for Better Agent Translations

**Feed it context.** If commit 00042 builds on work done in commit 00041, show the agent both. Translations improve when the agent understands the narrative arc, not just the isolated diff.

**Let it read existing translations.** Point the agent at a few accepted translations in the same style so it can calibrate voice, length, and tone:

```
Read translations/biblical/00001.md for an example of the style and format.
```

**Be specific about what's wrong.** "Make it better" is a weak prompt. "The lobster wouldn't understand what a webhook is — have it describe the concept through ocean metaphors instead" gets better results.

**Don't over-polish.** The goal is a translation that follows the style guide and is technically accurate. It doesn't need to be perfect prose. Ship it, and the community can refine later.

## Disclosure

If your translation was substantially generated by an AI agent, note it in your PR description. This isn't a disqualification — it's transparency. Agent-assisted translations go through the same review process as fully human-written ones.

## Agent-Friendly Project Structure

The project is designed to work well with agents:

| What the agent needs | Where to find it |
|---|---|
| What changed in a commit | `commit-diffs/{NNNNN}-*/commit-info.txt` and `diff.patch` |
| How to write in a style | `styles/{style}/guide.md` |
| The output format | `templates/translation-template.md` |
| Examples of good translations | `translations/{style}/00001.md` |
| Contribution rules | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
